I requested you to write to the City on Aug-24-2022. Have you given in writing the concerns of the people of Buttercup creek to Cedar Park City?
Can you please send me proof that you have done so?
Here is one truck today(Oct-04-2022): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPaNjeytHNnIpMsTSblggkizoGh896Di/view? usp=sharing
This is 18 wheeler Ranger Truck loaded with rocks. A small accident from this truck is enough to kill any resident on the spot.
Another incident: 2 weeks back a truck that passed our neighborhood dropped pebbles on the way. The stones are spread all through Gaspar bend, Steven Ct., Lauren Trail, and Nelson loop (and may be more places in the neighborhood). The stones are still lying on the road and no one is cleaning them. Look around, especially the curves where the truck took turns *such as the intersection of Anderson mill and Gaspar, intersection of Gaspar and Steven Ct, etc.
One such pebble has once caused serious damage to my fence as a speeding car just converted it to a projectile. The fense

  tore by the impact, and you can still visit to see the damage. This was in 2017 or 2018 and even after writing (with photo proof) to city engineers, and no-one showed up. I am still waiting here (year 2022). Imagine some person standing and got hit by that stone.
I think that the Cedar Park City and This HOA must exchange some mails/emails through their lawyers to finalize 'who will be liable' if these incidents carry on and one day cause a loss of life or even cause an accident. Will the city pay or HOA will pay to the person impacted. Do let me know if either party needs proof that these incidents happened or not. I will help to
my fullest with the recordings.

Not sure if some neighbor has started major renovation or this is just routine traffic passing through without permissions. I request you to kindly provide safety measures and take it with the city (keep things in writing of-course).

I understand that you are seeking correspondence between your HOA and the City re: traffic safety concerns. Ms. Quinn has processed your request and found no responsive informaUon. Ms. Quinn has personally advised me that she conducted an exhausUve search of the City’s email archiving so`ware and found no results with Mr. Denny (denney.james@westsidehoa.org) or any “@westsidehoa.org” email address as the sender/recipient. Stated differently, there is no email correspondence to provide. Aside from email correspondence, my understanding is that the City also does not have any responsive wrigen correspondence or other records matching your search criteria.
As a point of clarificaUon, if I may... The City is not subject to FOIA, the Freedom of InformaUon Act (federal law), but rather the Texas Public InformaUon Act (state law). The concept is the same – to promote transparency in government. In processing requests for informaUon under the Texas Public InformaUon Act, we use the search criteria provided – names, email addresses, dates, subject mager, key terms, etc. If the stated search criteria don’t turn up any results – as is the case with your request – there’s simply nothing to be provided. SomeUmes – NOT the case with your request – there are statutory provisions requiring and/or authorizing certain responsive informaUon to be withheld from disclosure. In these cases, we’re required to advise, in wriUng, of the basis for withholding and/or request a determinaUon from the Texas Agorney General, and we’re required to provide a copy of that request to the original ciUzen requestor. Again, this is NOT the case with your request, but I wanted you to know that if there was responsive informaUon that we’re withholding, state law requires us to let you know that we’re either withholding or seeking a determinaUon from the Agorney General.
Again, this is NOT a case of the City exercising discreUon in withholding informaUon responsive to your request. The City’s administraUve offices are located at City Hall, 450 Cypress Creek Rd., Bldg. #1, Cedar Park, Texas 78613. If you are seeking informaUon regarding legal process, causes of acUon, remedies, etc.,
    Page 4 of 402

 then I recommend you consult an agorney familiar with the Texas Public InformaUon Act. I/we cannot further advise re: legal magers.
Lastly, I would advise that we receive thousands of public informaUon requests each year, and we process each as quickly as possible, in the order its received, and pursuant to the Texas Public InformaUon Act, i.e. state law. You’re welcome to include our enUre staff on emails, but it won’t yield a different or faster response.

Dear Mrs. LeAnn:
I have raised numerous safety concerns to the city of cedar park and to my hoa (buttercup creek) for incoming 18 wheelers passing through with stones, and fuel. I have also requested my HOA to publicly and legally ask the city to work on all such incidents.
With this email, I would like to request you under FOIA to kindly provide me with any/all Requests and concerns that my HOA board or Board members may have asked in writing (or anything legally accepted in court) to the city of cedar park or vice-versa (i.e. from city to HOA) so as to help with increasing safety violations. To narrow down you search please I am okay with only last 10 months of communication (i.e. Jan-1- 2022 till Nov-1-2022).
Also, If you can compile that - If there are such requests made, then what departments worked on it, and what were the actions taken (temporary ones and the permanent ones)
I am also marking CC to JP.LeCompte as they may have worked on any legal requests that were passed by my HOA or their representatives (including board members, lawyers office

I understand that you are seeking correspondence between your HOA and the City re: traffic safety concerns. Ms. Quinn has processed your request and found no responsive informaUon. Ms. Quinn has personally advised me that she conducted an exhausUve search of the City’s email archiving so`ware and found no results with Mr. Denny (denney.james@westsidehoa.org) or any “@westsidehoa.org” email address as the sender/recipient. Stated differently, there is no email correspondence to provide. Aside from email correspondence, my understanding is that the City also does not have any responsive wrigen correspondence or other records matching your search criteria.
As a point of clarificaUon, if I may... The City is not subject to FOIA, the Freedom of InformaUon Act (federal law), but rather the Texas Public InformaUon Act (state law). The concept is the same – to promote transparency in government. In processing requests for informaUon under the Texas Public InformaUon Act, we use the search criteria provided – names, email addresses, dates, subject mager, key terms, etc. If the stated search criteria don’t turn up any results – as is the case with your request – there’s simply nothing to be provided. SomeUmes – NOT the case with your request – there are statutory provisions requiring and/or authorizing certain responsive informaUon to be withheld from disclosure. In these cases, we’re required to advise, in wriUng, of the basis for withholding and/or request a determinaUon from the Texas Agorney General, and we’re required to provide a copy of that request to the original ciUzen requestor. Again, this is NOT the case with your request, but I wanted you to know that if there was responsive informaUon that we’re withholding, state law requires us to let you know that we’re either withholding or seeking a determinaUon from the Agorney General.
Again, this is NOT a case of the City exercising discreUon in withholding informaUon responsive to your request. The City’s administraUve offices are located at City Hall, 450 Cypress Creek Rd., Bldg. #1, Cedar

 Park, Texas 78613. If you are seeking informaUon regarding legal process, causes of acUon, remedies, etc., then I recommend you consult an agorney familiar with the Texas Public InformaUon Act. I/we cannot further advise re: legal magers.
Lastly, I would advise that we receive thousands of public informaUon requests each year, and we process each as quickly as possible, in the order its received, and pursuant to the Texas Public InformaUon Act, i.e. state law. You’re welcome to include our enUre staff on emails, but it won’t yield a different or faster response.

I have raised numerous safety concerns to the city of cedar park and to my hoa (buttercup creek) for incoming 18 wheelers passing through with stones, and fuel. I have also requested my HOA to publicly and legally ask the city to work on all such incidents.
With this email, I would like to request you under FOIA to kindly provide me with any/all Requests and concerns that my HOA board or Board members may have asked in writing (or anything legally accepted in court) to the city of cedar park or vice-versa (i.e. from city to HOA) so as to help with increasing safety violations. To narrow down you search please I am okay with only last 10 months of communication (i.e. Jan-1- 2022 till Nov-1-2022).
Also, If you can compile that - If there are such requests made, then what departments worked on it, and what were the actions taken (temporary ones and the permanent ones)
       I am also marking CC to JP.LeCompte as they may have worked on any legal requests that

3. Timeframe is Jan-01-2022 Ull Nov-01-2022(both end date included) Feel free to email me if this is sUll not clear

   In relaUon to your Public InformaUon Request received by electronic mail on November 8, 2022, the City will need addiUonal clarificaUon in order to conUnue processing your request.
Please clarify and provide:
1. The name of the Homeowner’s AssociaUon you are referencing.
2. The Board Member names.
a. HOA’s are not required to register with the City, therefore we have no record that would idenUfy Board Members by name.
3. A Umeframe for which you are seeking with a beginning and an ending date.
By providing the above informaUon, this will assist the City with searching for any responsive doucments you are seeking.
Thank you.

Dear Mrs. LeAnn:
I have raised numerous safety concerns to the city of cedar park and to my hoa (buttercup creek) for incoming 18 wheelers passing through with stones, and fuel. I have also requested my HOA to publicly and legally ask the city to work on all such incidents.
With this email, I would like to request you under FOIA to kindly provide me with any/all Requests and concerns that my HOA board or Board members may have asked in writing (or anything legally accepted in court) to the city of cedar park or vice-versa (i.e. from city to HOA) so as to help with increasing safety violations. To narrow down you search please I am okay with only last 10 months of communication (i.e. Jan-1- 2022 till Nov-1-2022).
Also, If you can compile that - If there are such requests made, then what departments worked on it, and what were the actions taken (temporary ones and the permanent ones)

     I am also marking CC to JP.LeCompte as they may have worked on any legal requests that were passed by my HOA or their representatives (including board members, lawyers office etc).
Will appreciate the response from you or Mr. JP LeCompte.

Mr. Kalra,
I understand that you are seeking correspondence between your HOA and the City re: traffic safety concerns. Ms. Quinn has processed your request and found no responsive informaUon. Ms. Quinn has personally advised me that she conducted an exhausUve search of the City’s email archiving so`ware and found no results with Mr. Denny (denney.james@westsidehoa.org) or any “@westsidehoa.org” email address as the sender/recipient. Stated differently, there is no email correspondence to provide. Aside from email correspondence, my understanding is that the City also does not have any responsive wrigen correspondence or other records matching your search criteria.
As a point of clarificaUon, if I may... The City is not subject to FOIA, the Freedom of InformaUon Act (federal law), but rather the Texas Public InformaUon Act (state law). The concept is the same – to promote transparency in government. In processing requests for informaUon under the Texas Public InformaUon Act, we use the search criteria provided – names, email addresses, dates, subject mager, key terms, etc. If the stated search criteria don’t turn up any results – as is the case with your request – there’s simply nothing to be provided. SomeUmes – NOT the case with your request – there are statutory provisions requiring and/or authorizing certain responsive informaUon to be withheld from disclosure. In these cases, we’re required to advise, in wriUng, of the basis for withholding and/or request a determinaUon from the Texas Agorney General, and we’re required to provide a copy of that request to the original ciUzen requestor. Again, this is NOT the case with your request, but I wanted you to know that if there was responsive informaUon that we’re withholding, state law requires us to let you know that we’re either withholding or seeking a determinaUon from the Agorney General.
Again, this is NOT a case of the City exercising discreUon in withholding informaUon responsive to your request. The City’s administraUve offices are located at City Hall, 450 Cypress Creek Rd., Bldg. #1, Cedar Park, Texas 78613. If you are seeking informaUon regarding legal process, causes of acUon, remedies, etc., then I recommend you consult an agorney familiar with the Texas Public InformaUon Act. I/we cannot further advise re: legal magers.
Lastly, I would advise that we receive thousands of public informaUon requests each year, and we process each as quickly as possible, in the order its received, and pursuant to the Texas Public InformaUon Act, i.e. state law. You’re welcome to include our enUre staff on emails, but it won’t yield a different or faster response.

Also, If you can compile that - If there are such requests made, then what departments worked on it, and what were the actions taken (temporary ones and the permanent ones)
I am also marking CC to JP.LeCompte as they may have worked on any legal requests that were passed by my HOA or their representatives (including board members, lawyers office etc).

 My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, _cedar park, tx 78613. It is at the intersection of gaspar bend and anderson mill road.
Since the last 4+ years multiple commercial 18-wheelers trucks loaded with stones, and many times with fuel, have crossed the neighborhood. Each entrance to the neighborhood has a "no pass through trucks" sign. They are not allowed in the neighborhood hence they are "unauthorized".
The video proofs are all shared links and you may open from any public computer or cell phone. If they do not work for you, I can work to upload them all to youtube for you. Does youtube work for you? There must be 25+ incidents each year, and in many cases the zoomed up picture will show the license number, etc. In all my reports, I have also mentioned the day and time. All my emails can also be uploaded to GITHUB so that they can be seen from any public computer. I have sent documents to the Williamson county legal department using github earlier.. they have not reported any issue of being unable to open. In total the proofs are in Gigabyte and cannot be shared as direct zip files.
This intersection and most of the road projects that city engineers developed in the last 30 years *was without any* safety checks. A typical truck entering and exiting the neighborhood crosses at least 50+ houses (or +/- 200 people) and at least crosses 1 elementary school connection road. A written proof from a licensed cedar park city engineer plus the cross validation of the design document can be produced if asked for (here or in court).
This makes me and my family and hundreds of more neighbors susceptible to safety risk. The local HOA and City are not acting on it. They are not open to work while holding the position that they fought for in elections and to serve..They may be purposefully hurting people if they are not acting on it and that is what it looks like to me now after chasing it for years and seeing 0 results. I will be requesting communication between HOA and City under FOIA and send you the response to FOIA once I file it with the city.
I am open to emails, have recorded zoom meetings with you, upload proofs to any public site - youtube, github, google- shared drive, etc. Please let me know what works for you.

Subject: another ranger truck spoged today
EXTERNAL email: Exercise cauSon when opening.
Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022- Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMOVYTAOaw3S3p90qO9n8iix65hzS9rw/view?usp=sharing https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AiMpwJCfoCqKmzN33ZYPC_6nwObtV6SY/view?usp=sharing

Dear WBC board members:
I have numerous times raised safety concerns due to 18-wheelers and fuel tankers passing through the neighborhood. Safety is my right and you are there to protect me. I have asked this board to act on many occasions and have copied almost all incidents that I have reported, and I have specifically asked this board to raise in writing to the city so that a legal case can be pre prepared. I have asked the reply to this request 2 times in last 2+ months, and after waiting for 2 months I am bound to ask the same using FOIA.
I have some questions and I need the answers. This request is made under FOIA:
[1]- was there any legal request made by this board or board members during the period of jan-01-2022 till nov-01- 2022 that raised the same concerns to the cedar park city.
[2]- was there any legal request made by the city to the board and/or members, during the same period to act on the concerns of the residents of the neighborhood?
[3]- in the case of [1] or [2], was there any action taken by this board?
Please let me know the response in some reasonable days.

Dear Connie Odom:
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, _cedar park, tx 78613. It is at the intersection of gaspar bend and anderson mill road.
Since the last 4+ years multiple commercial 18-wheelers trucks loaded with stones, and many times with fuel, have crossed the neighborhood. Each entrance to the neighborhood has a "no pass through trucks" sign. They are not allowed in the neighborhood hence they are "unauthorized".
The video proofs are all shared links and you may open from any public computer or cell phone. If they do not work for you, I can work to upload them all to youtube for you. Does youtube work for you? There must be 25+ incidents each year, and in many cases the zoomed up picture will show the license number, etc. In all my reports, I have also mentioned the day and time. All my emails can also be uploaded to GITHUB so that they can be seen from any public computer. I have sent documents to the Williamson county legal department using github earlier.. they have not reported any issue of being unable to open. In total the proofs are in Gigabyte and cannot be shared as direct zip files.
This intersection and most of the road projects that city engineers developed in the last 30 years *was without any* safety checks. A typical truck entering and exiting the neighborhood crosses at least 50+ houses (or +/- 200 people) and at least crosses 1 elementary school connection road. A written proof from a licensed cedar park city engineer plus the cross validation of the design document can be produced if asked for (here or in court).
This makes me and my family and hundreds of more neighbors susceptible to safety risk. The local HOA and City are not acting on it. They are not open to work while holding the position that they fought for in elections and to serve..They may be purposefully hurting people if they are not acting on it and that is what it looks like to me now after chasing it for years and seeing 0 results. I will be requesting communication between HOA and City under FOIA and send you the response to FOIA once I file it with the city.

I am open to emails, have recorded zoom meetings with you, upload proofs to any public site - youtube, github, google-shared drive, etc. Please let me know what works for you.

  Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper- pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMOVYTAOaw3S3p90qO9n8iix65hzS9rw/view?usp=sharing https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AiMpwJCfoCqKmzN33ZYPC_6nwObtV6SY/view?usp=sharing

Here is one truck today(Oct-04-2022): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPaNjeytHNnIpMsTSblggkizoGh896Di/view? usp=sharing
This is 18 wheeler Ranger Truck loaded with rocks. A small accident from this truck is enough to kill any resident on the spot.
Another incident: 2 weeks back a truck that passed our neighborhood dropped pebbles on the way. The stones are spread all through Gaspar bend, Steven Ct., Lauren Trail, and Nelson loop (and may be more places in the neighborhood). The stones are still lying on the road and no one is cleaning them. Look around, especially the curves where the truck took turns *such as the intersection of Anderson mill and Gaspar, intersection of Gaspar and Steven Ct, etc.
One such pebble has once caused serious damage to my fence as a speeding car just converted it to a projectile. The fense tore by the impact, and you can still visit to see the damage. This was in 2017 or 2018 and even after writing (with photo proof) to city engineers, and no-one showed up. I am still waiting here (year 2022). Imagine some person standing and got hit by that stone.
I think that the Cedar Park City and This HOA must exchange some mails/emails through their lawyers to finalize 'who will be liable' if these incidents carry on and one day cause a loss of life or even cause an accident. Will the city pay or HOA will pay to the person impacted. Do let me know if either party needs proof that these incidents happened or not. I will help to
my fullest with the recordings.

One such pebble has once caused serious damage to my fence as a speeding car just converted it to a projectile. The fense tore by the impact, and you can still visit to see the damage. This was in 2017 or 2018 and even after writing (with photo proof) to city engineers, and no-one showed up. I am still waiting here (year 2022). Imagine some person standing and got hit by that stone.
I think that the Cedar Park City and This HOA must exchange some mails/emails through their lawyers to finalize 'who will be liable' if these incidents carry on and one day cause a loss of life or even cause an accident. Will the city pay or HOA will pay to the person impacted. Do let me know if either party needs proof that these incidents happened or not. I will help to my fullest with the recordings.

Hi HOA Board:
I requested you to write to the City on Aug-24-2022. Have you given in writing the concerns of the people of Buttercup creek to Cedar Park City?
Can you please send me proof that you have done so?
Here is one truck today(Oct-04-2022): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPaNjeytHNnIpMsTSblggkizoGh896Di/view? usp=sharing
This is 18 wheeler Ranger Truck loaded with rocks. A small accident from this truck is enough to kill any resident on the spot.
Another incident: 2 weeks back a truck that passed our neighborhood dropped pebbles on the way. The stones are spread all through Gaspar bend, Steven Ct., Lauren Trail, and Nelson loop (and may be more places in the neighborhood). The stones are still lying on the road and no one is cleaning them. Look around, especially the curves where the truck took turns *such as the intersection of Anderson mill and Gaspar, intersection of Gaspar and Steven Ct, etc.

Dear Mr. Denney, and respected board members:
I do not want to push HOA to bankruptcy, but at the same time asking you all to kindly consider public-safety with the utmost priority. There are huge trucks, gas trucks, and heavy equipment loaded trucks traveling in this neighborhood just because it connects few heavy running roads.
We are at doorstep where any mishap can happen any day and all we will end up doing is pointing to others for not acting firmly.
If asking the city to hand over the roads is not an option then I would like the HOA to take some other concrete steps.. Make sure these attempts are in writing and not some hanky panky verbal communication in the corner of city hall that does not show your best efforts.
Here are a few more options:
1. Ask the city to install permanently speed-meters and Lidar cameras on all entrances and exits.
2. If they see residents reporting the violation, these speed meters and cameras must be good enough to capture the details and fines the violators.
3. If the city does not have budget or thrust to install them, then ask them to permit HOA to install these and let the proofs be allowed to suffice and extract fines split with HOA so that it can then payback for the original cost that HOA may have to pay. 4. Escalate to state representatives if city officials aren't working.
5. If nothing works - Invite a few newspapers, and state media journals to capture the needs of people.
Just do not sit with hands-on-hands and preach to me that this cannot be done. Because all the above points are possible. I have already volunteered for HOA.. Please accept that and I will do it for you all!
BTW, These are not exhaustive but are certainly a good starting point. You all are free to suggest more to this list.

Sandeep, a`er researching a bit more, the HOA would have to purchase all of the roads in the neighborhood and make them private.
If the city were to allow the sale of the streets, it would be at fair market value and then the HOA would be responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the roads.
I am not sure how much the purchase of the roads would be but my guess is that it would be in the 10s of millions of dollars. The HOA does not currently have that type of money and we do not have the ability to levy a tax or issue bonds.
I do not believe this is a feasible soluUon but if you want to do the research and present opUons to the board, we are willing to listen.

 There are kids, pedestrians, and many more that are at risk.
I will also request HOA to start thinking about installing private entrance gates with some electronic fobs at all entrances and exits if the situation is not solvable otherwise.
I can send video proofs if you want. I just witnessed one right now (Friday MArch -25, @5:32PM CST). This is the 3rd incident I have seen in the last 2 weeks.

 Mr. Denney.
Your points are invalid.
Let me explain a bit. I do not have to declare volunteership to show my affection to neighbors or neighbors. I emailed you all that trucks are unlawfully entering the neighborhood. Who acted on it?
I dealt with the city single handed while you all were not ready to send city stern/strong legal messages or CPPD to act on it. Leave that, there was no email to raise concern or involvement of any one of you sitting there or these 3 newcomers to take up these concerns with neighbors.
Same goes with City violations that happened right on my property with one neighbor being the city and their road. None of you (HOA, not personal) took any action. I am fighting not only for me, but for all living on Lakeline rd. I have been in advanced talks with different national level government agencies and also planning to take it with President Biden's office. What is this if not volunteering ?
Same goes with your book keepings. I pointed out that your hired company is not keeping clean books, and there is a chance of pointing fingers. What did any of these other volunteers or sitting current board members do? What actions were taken? Where is the MOM with resolution to all this? Why are you pointing one finger to me when 3 are pointing back to you all?
I can come to meetings and I will say these again. What will volunteering officially do if my unofficial volunteering is of 0 value to this board?
Also, let me tell you one more thing. This is specific to you Mr. Denney. You are posting to me all the different reasons for one thing or the other.
Examples from your reasonings of past:
- why HOA can increase annual fee when there is $14M surplus in bank? because " other HOA has increased it too"
- "On making Border walls" you said in the meeting "HOA cannot work for individual property because it is only for the
welfare of all properties".
- and now this, "volunteering is the first step to HOA leadership roles" ..
NONE of these arguments are legal and not rules. YOU are MAKING it up and imposing on me! Send me legal docs that show these rules are there for which HOA was formed!
And lastly, what if for some unfortunate reason (covid, accidents, personal problems, etc) the sitting HOA board or volunteers are no longer with HOA? Will this mean that now there is no HOA because no one is qualified to take leadership positions?

My point Sandeep is that you and your 11th graders have yet to volunteer to do anything posiUve for our neighborhood. All I have ever seen from you are complaints and venom. The fact that these people are showing up to meeUngs and volunteering their Ume already makes them much more qualified than someone who constantly complains without offering soluUons.
The chat funcUon in meeUngs is a way to object to anything you hear in meeUngs and offers a wrigen record. The chat funcUon also it is available throughout the meeUng and we actually stop meeUng to answer quesUons. Your statement below is not accurate.
We volunteer our Ume and the last thing we want to do is parUcipate in an arguing match with a homeowner or have a homeowner constantly interrupt meeUngs. Any homeowner who wants to meet individually with with board is more than welcome to schedule a meeUng, where during that Ume, they can air their grievances or concerns.
This system of meeUngs works for us during the pandemic but I assure you we will all be greaÅul to return to

The participation in these meetings is not a qualification to take up a role that needs real spine to talk to city, district and legal departments. My 11th grader and his friends will participate next. What will that bring?
Moreover, I did show up in a few meetings earlier even when you were not there. The meetings are not two way communication.
The zoom controller mutes anyone and does not allow them to object to things as they proceed. Only QA is taken when most of the people are left.
Even f2f meetings when they were conducted were not that way.

Had you have shown up to any of the meeUngs this year, maybe you would have met Cheryl, Jason or Andrew. They have all stepped in as replacements for board members who have stepped down. There are 3 open posiUons and these people are the only homeowners who have stepped up to volunteer. If you would like to ask them quesUons, please forward them to me and I will ensure that they receive the quesUons but they are under no obligaUon to answer your quesUons and if you do not like that, then don't vote or write in a candidate.
Also your comment about SaraMarie is quite obtuse. She did more for this community than almost any other homeowner or board member previous to her or since. If you have a personal vendega against her it would be best to keep that to yourself in future communicaUons or you will be ignored and blocked. I will not tolerate personal agacks on board members or homeowners.

The participation in these meetings is not a qualification to take up a role that needs real spine to talk to city, district and legal departments. My 11th grader and his friends will participate next. What will that bring?
Moreover, I did show up in a few meetings earlier even when you were not there. The meetings are not two way communication. The zoom controller mutes anyone and does not allow them to object to things as they proceed. Only QA is taken when most of the people are left.
Even f2f meetings when they were conducted were not that way.

Had you have shown up to any of the meeUngs this year, maybe you would have met Cheryl, Jason or Andrew. They have all stepped in as replacements for board members who have stepped down. There are 3 open posiUons and these people are the only homeowners who have stepped up to volunteer. If you would like to ask them quesUons, please forward them to me and I will ensure that they receive the quesUons but they are under no obligaUon to answer your quesUons and if you do not like that, then don't vote or write in a candidate.
Also your comment about SaraMarie is quite obtuse. She did more for this community than almost any other homeowner or board member previous to her or since. If you have a personal vendega against her it would be best to keep that to yourself in future communicaUons or you will be ignored and blocked. I will not tolerate personal agacks on board members or homeowners.
Good day sir, Denney James.

FYI All:
I fully and loudly reject any director or HOA positions chosen this non democratic way that seems mostly illegal. I have voted myself(+my wife, and one neighbor) to block my vote or vote for anyone of the 3 candidates.. and can revisit if things change. This is blind-dart game in this HOA which is anyways running as a monopoly. Please reconsider and modify the voting methods. I do not accept any candidature unless then.

We received this Hotline Complaint from you regarding allegaUons that the City of Cedar Park is “building roads without any safety calculaUons”. However, there was nothing to support any of the allegaUons or your claims.
What type of “safety calculaUons” are not being done by the City of Cedar Park?
[SandeepK] The city engineers, and contract firms decided to pull the road next to residents property (earlier the distance was 35ft + walkway of 7 feet, and now at some point as close as 11 feet with only safety of a 6 inch curb. City also removed 50+ yrs old trees that were also acting as protection) but did not follow PE guidelines and did "no"(none, zero) engineering safety calculation as per TBPE guidelines (Proof: https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/enf_pub.pdf, section 1001.003, 137.33 e, and lookup word "calculations") such as what kind of vehicle and what speed is safe for this kind of structure. They were supposed to use physics, and maths to do safety calculations. Instead they only did "accounting estimates" and posted them against estimates. One of the sides of the road is open to winds as it faces BCCP land and there is no structure there. YouTube is filled
     Page 120 of 402

with videos such as these (one such Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG22JlcZnMk) that shows that high wind will make 18 wheelers fly. With no barrier, or gap between property and road except walkway a high wind can cause catastrophe to pedestrians.
I also pointed out that the 18 wheelers had in the past converted a pebble on the road as a vehicle to destroy a brand new installed fence(proof attached as screen shot). Email to city engineers showed with picture proof how a pebble from a speeding truck tore the wooden fence. There could have been a kid in that spot.
A drunk driver on a truck also is a moving missile. I hope you do not want proof of this. You can fetch thousands of reports from any police department.
Video proof of such trucks travelling unlawfully in the locality (some caring fuel). Unfortunately the angle of installation fails to capture incoming traffic and mostly capture outgoing:

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof. For proof sake i am attaching just one of the email threads. They go really long.
                        Page 121 of 402

   Page 122 of 402

  The earlier distance between walkway to road distance would have prevented any of these 3 cases. A new structure was implemented when I raised the concerns in writing (concerns.pdf, proof attached) with all these points raised. Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allegaUons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Page 123 of 402

Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calculaUons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
What acUon do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allegaUons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road.
2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place. 5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.
In order for us to consider these claims, please provide any supporUng informaUon or documentaUon. Thank you,

    Hi FHWA,
I have been recommended by DOT.gov to send this info to FHWA Tx Division instead. Please find the email with the details below. I am not sure if this comes
under the whistleblower act or not, but it is serious matter as it impacts life of a lot of Americans on the road.
I recommend you to look into the matter, and if there were no studies done, then do some to see if decisions such as these are impacting or not.

DescripUon of the fraud, waste, and/or abuse:
Fraud & Abuse of powers - This may apply to a lot of US ciUes in Texas, but certainly my city - Cedar Park TX (78613) is one, and the Umeframe of the abuse menUoned here goes in YEARS *25+ years*.
The city engineers have been building roads without any safety calculaUons. They outsource drawings from other firms where also there are no safety calculaUons done. City engineers (Licensed and unlicensed combined) do not push the firms to do the calculaUons.
T.B.P.E (Texas Board of PE Engineers) was contacted in this respect too, but they said that they cannot rule over decisions made by city P.E. engineers. This has been happening from last 25+ years in Cedar Park. From the sense of interacUon with city and TBPE it seems not wrong to assume that this has been pracUce in a lot texas ciUes. (Cannot say for sure for other ciUes - but they were not surprised by the learnings). On asking for calculaUons, city provided me with what Engineers has been submiÜng as "calculaUons" and "esUmates" and it was actually "accounUng calculaUons". Cedar Park TX is just 20 miles from AusUn capital. You can extrapolate to see what is the level of engineering fraud going on.
All data menUoned by me above here is backed by FOIA, and wrigen communicaUon with TBPE, Cedar Park City Council, Cedar Park City Engineers. I can present my data if needed. More so, the cedar park city has not indicated to me that they will take any acUon w.r.t this.
I as a student am also interested in running Machine learning regression algo. to find the correlaUon but could not find dataset on your website NHSTA w.r.t. any accident studies done where the correlaUon to this parameters were studied. I will equally be interested in finding the data to run models myself (if anything or this sort was collected earlier). In case there is data available, then i will like to see that data.

We received this Hotline Complaint from you regarding allegaUons that the City of Cedar Park is “building roads without any safety calculaUons”. However, there was nothing to support any of the

allegaUons or your claims.
What type of “safety calculaUons” are not being done by the City of Cedar Park?
[SandeepK] The city engineers, and contract firms decided to pull the road next to residents property (earlier the distance was 35ft + walkway of 7 feet, and now at some point as close as 11 feet with only safety of a 6 inch curb. City also removed 50+ yrs old trees that were also acting as protection) but did not follow PE guidelines and did "no"(none, zero) engineering safety calculation as per TBPE guidelines (Proof: https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/enf_pub.pdf, section 1001.003, 137.33 e, and lookup word "calculations") such as what kind of vehicle and what speed is safe for this kind of structure. They were supposed to use physics, and maths to do safety calculations. Instead they only did "accounting estimates" and posted them against estimates. One of the sides of the road is open to winds as it faces BCCP land and there is no structure there. YouTube is filled with videos such as these (one such Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG22JlcZnMk) that shows that high wind will make 18 wheelers fly. With no barrier, or gap between property and road except walkway a high wind can cause catastrophe to pedestrians.
I also pointed out that the 18 wheelers had in the past converted a pebble on the road as a vehicle to destroy a brand new installed fence(proof attached as screen shot). Email to city engineers showed with picture proof how a pebble from a speeding truck tore the wooden fence. There could have been a kid in that spot.
A drunk driver on a truck also is a moving missile. I hope you do not want proof of this. You can fetch thousands of reports from any police department.
Video proof of such trucks travelling unlawfully in the locality (some caring fuel). Unfortunately the angle of installation fails to capture incoming traffic and mostly capture outgoing:

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof. For proof sake i am attaching just one of the email threads. They go really long.
                        Page 129 of 402

     Page 130 of 402

   The earlier distance between walkway to road distance would have prevented any of these 3 cases. A new structure was implemented when I raised the concerns in writing (concerns.pdf, proof attached) with all these points raised. Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allegaUons being made?
Page 131 of 402

On what type of roads or projects are these allegaUons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calculaUons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
What acUon do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allegaUons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road.
2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place.
   Page 132 of 402

5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.

DescripUon of the fraud, waste, and/or abuse:
Fraud & Abuse of powers - This may apply to a lot of US ciUes in Texas, but certainly my city - Cedar Park TX (78613) is one, and the Umeframe of the abuse menUoned here goes in YEARS *25+ years*.
The city engineers have been building roads without any safety calculaUons. They outsource drawings from other firms where also there are no safety calculaUons done. City engineers (Licensed and unlicensed combined) do not push the firms to do the calculaUons.
T.B.P.E (Texas Board of PE Engineers) was contacted in this respect too, but they said that they cannot rule over decisions made by city P.E. engineers. This has been happening from last 25+ years in Cedar Park. From the sense of interacUon with city and TBPE it seems not wrong to assume that this has been pracUce in a lot texas ciUes. (Cannot say for sure for other ciUes - but they were not surprised by the learnings). On asking for calculaUons, city provided me with what Engineers has been submiÜng as "calculaUons" and "esUmates" and it was actually "accounUng calculaUons". Cedar Park TX is just 20 miles from AusUn capital. You can extrapolate to see what is the level of engineering fraud going on.
All data menUoned by me above here is backed by FOIA, and wrigen communicaUon with TBPE, Cedar Park City Council, Cedar Park City Engineers. I can present my data if needed. More so, the cedar park city has not indicated to me that they will take any acUon w.r.t this.
I as a student am also interested in running Machine learning regression algo. to find the correlaUon but could not find dataset on your website NHSTA w.r.t. any accident studies done where the correlaUon to this parameters were studied. I will equally be interested in finding the data to run models myself (if anything or this sort was collected earlier). In case there is data available, then i will like to see that data.

DescripUon of the fraud, waste, and/or abuse:
Fraud & Abuse of powers - This may apply to a lot of US ciUes in Texas, but certainly my city - Cedar Park TX (78613) is one, and the Umeframe of the abuse menUoned here goes in YEARS *25+ years*.
The city engineers have been building roads without any safety calculaUons. They outsource drawings from other firms where also there are no safety calculaUons done. City engineers (Licensed and unlicensed combined) do not push the firms to do the calculaUons.
T.B.P.E (Texas Board of PE Engineers) was contacted in this respect too, but they said that they cannot rule over decisions made by city P.E. engineers. This has been happening from last 25+ years in Cedar Park. From the sense of interacUon with city and TBPE it seems not wrong to assume that this has been pracUce in a lot texas ciUes. (Cannot say for sure for other ciUes - but they were not surprised by the learnings). On asking for calculaUons, city provided me with what Engineers has been submiÜng as "calculaUons" and "esUmates" and it was actually "accounUng calculaUons". Cedar Park TX is just 20 miles from AusUn capital. You can extrapolate to see what is the level of engineering fraud going on.
All data menUoned by me above here is backed by FOIA, and wrigen communicaUon with TBPE, Cedar Park City Council, Cedar Park City Engineers. I can present my data if needed. More so, the cedar park city has not indicated to me that they will take any acUon w.r.t this.
I as a student am also interested in running Machine learning regression algo. to find the correlaUon but could not find dataset on your website NHSTA w.r.t. any accident studies done where the correlaUon to this parameters were studied. I will equally be interested in finding the data to run models myself (if anything or this sort was collected earlier). In case there is data available, then i will like to see that data.

Mr. Kalra,
We received this Hotline Complaint from you regarding allegaUons that the City of Cedar Park is

“building roads without any safety calculaUons”. However, there was nothing to support any of the allegaUons or your claims.
What type of “safety calculaUons” are not being done by the City of Cedar Park?
[SandeepK] The city engineers, and contract firms decided to pull the road next to residents property (earlier the distance was 35ft + walkway of 7 feet, and now at some point as close as 11 feet with only safety of a 6 inch curb. City also removed 50+ yrs old trees that were also acting as protection) but did not follow PE guidelines and did "no"(none, zero) engineering safety calculation as per TBPE guidelines (Proof: https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/enf_pub.pdf, section 1001.003, 137.33 e, and lookup word "calculations") such as what kind of vehicle and what speed is safe for this kind of structure. They were supposed to use physics, and maths to do safety calculations. Instead they only did "accounting estimates" and posted them against estimates. One of the sides of the road is open to winds as it faces BCCP land and there is no structure there. YouTube is filled with videos such as these (one such Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG22JlcZnMk) that shows that high wind will make 18 wheelers fly. With no barrier, or gap between property and road except walkway a high wind can cause catastrophe to pedestrians.
I also pointed out that the 18 wheelers had in the past converted a pebble on the road as a vehicle to destroy a brand new installed fence(proof attached as screen shot). Email to city engineers showed with picture proof how a pebble from a speeding truck tore the wooden fence. There could have been a kid in that spot.
A drunk driver on a truck also is a moving missile. I hope you do not want proof of this. You can fetch thousands of reports from any police department.
Video proof of such trucks travelling unlawfully in the locality (some caring fuel). Unfortunately the angle of installation fails to capture incoming traffic and mostly capture outgoing:

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof. For proof sake i am attaching just one of the email threads. They go really long.
                        Page 147 of 402

     Page 148 of 402

   The earlier distance between walkway to road distance would have prevented any of these 3 cases. A new structure was implemented when I raised the concerns in writing (concerns.pdf, proof attached) with all these points raised. Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allegaUons being made?
Page 149 of 402

On what type of roads or projects are these allegaUons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calculaUons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
What acUon do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allegaUons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road.
2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place.
   Page 150 of 402

5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.
In order for us to consider these claims, please provide any supporUng informaUon or documentaUon. Thank you,

    Hi FHWA,
I have been recommended by DOT.gov to send this info to FHWA Tx Division instead. Please find the email with the details below. I am not sure if this comes
under the whistleblower act or not, but it is serious matter as it impacts life of a lot of Americans on the road.
I recommend you to look into the matter, and if there were no studies done, then do some to see if decisions such as these are impacting or not.

Sara:
a) Why this email now? This email from HOA is 2.5 yrs late.
I have lost confidence in HOA. To gain my confidence, please reply to question-b of this email
b) The residents were all were at your monthly HOA meeting inn May-2017 raising the concerns. HOA was there on the day (May-22,2017) when the city called for meeting. I read the whole concerns.pdf document that I also emailed to city. For period of May-2017 and Oct-2019:
Where are the proofs that HOA worked for safety , security, health and welfare of residents if you or anyone in HOA worked and fought for my rights then I will feel confident that you all will represent the owners correctly. When and with Whom did you (or anyone in HOA) interacted with in city to raise concern of the residents? Where is the email chain, or mail, or any record to prove.
c) the concern document is shared with many in HOA and City. Nothing has changed from my side.
They were delivered in written format, and I can clarify if the English isn't clear (I am not a native English speaker)

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the
concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on
     Page 157 of 402

       my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Subject: Re: Notice of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in- charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs in GOOGLE LINK as attachment did not work - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

            house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more
then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov- 15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here.
Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please. Sandeep Kalra

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
           Page 163 of 402

               I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
 Page 164 of 402

               [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaUonale --
 Page 165 of 402

               Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise
control. No trees. No polluUon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
 Page 166 of 402

               - The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are
running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the
valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below
Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken
on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended
    Page 171 of 402

  Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year). If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road. Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

What is the stand of city for these things:

SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and below 75db at night (7 pm to 7 am) with exceptions including "motor vehicle motor" (but not tires or any other parts of the vehicle).
reference: https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=7111
I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are expert in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know. I was in this field of engineering few years back and may give you all some references.

Thank you for your email. SecUon 14.07.007 of the Cedar Park Code of Ordinances (CPCO) regulates fences. I have provided the secUon of the CPCO below for your review. A permit is not required to replace your privacy fence located on your property, but the maximum height is limited to 8 feet. While the City does not enforce deed restricUons or Covenants, CondiUons, and RestricUons (CC&Rs), I recommend you confirm the 8’ masonry wall comply with any HOA requirements that exist. Please let me know if you have any quesUons related to the fencing regulaUons below.

You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road.

The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?

           I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out.

Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this.

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough

             data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fenc

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to- 20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
           Page 185 of 402

                     We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[Plan1] Wewillacceptthe8`wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non-revokable, and with no statuary- limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
 Page 186 of 402

                     [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaUonale --
 Page 187 of 402

                     Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar
situaUons. No Noise
control. No trees. No polluUon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others
pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
 Page 188 of 402

                     - By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
 Page 189 of 402

                     They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.

I am following up on the email below. Since the fence construcUon is about to start someUme next week, I just wanted to check and see if the right-of-entry withdrawal is sUll in effect. The fence contractor will only be out there for about a week and if you want your fence reconstructed, he needs to complete this work while he is out there. We won’t be paying an addiUonal mobilizaUon fee for the contractor to come back out there a`er he finished the other secUons of fence.

Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below
  Page 192 of 402

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 16:45:55 Central Standard Time
  Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

 I really am sorry for calling you 'Sara'. I always remains a bit confused when it comes to name (for e.g. Sam, but name is Samuel, etc). My intention was not to hurt you. I take this learning forward, and will call all in this email and probably in other places by full names, with Dear, Mr. or Ms. or whatever they prefer to call.
All:
I am not a native English speaker, and many times it becomes a challenge when I ask for things in ways that others feel bad about. I will like to take the opportunity here to reply to all (not just representatives of HOA , but also representatives City, and the engineers, contractors, and anyone in this chain) that:
Please consider this email as my heartfelt apology for using below standards language to show my dissatisfaction in the system. I must have never spoken unkind words even if you were not performing your duties correctly. It is just not right and I am sorry for my language.
There was nothing 'personal' (and nor 'is') when it comes to my questioning of your
actions/or non-actions to be correct. The intent is only to question about your 'professional' conducts and abilities (which I mean must have some sense of general knowledge, beyond what rule books tells you, not meant to disobey rules in any ways ) as you all are representing HOA, CITY and in general AMERICAN QUALITY of life to anyone who visits and resides legally in your town, or city.
I hope you will accept my apology in this regards.
I will re-draft my questions in better English to the City (and Engineering there) to get the right answers. This email may not come today my health isn't doing well with the sudden drastic change in weather. Also, with my subsequent emails, I will remove all HOA board members, HOA manager, and other HOA reps. unless someone replies to this email(in person or reply-all) be in loop.

Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:
----
SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
       Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
 Page 195 of 402

    In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and below 75db at night (7 pm to 7 am) with exceptions including "motor vehicle motor" (but not tires or any other parts of the vehicle).
reference: https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=7111
I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are expert in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know. I was in this field of engineering few years back and may give you all some references.

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements.

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some
bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
   General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
 Page 200 of 402

            With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it woul likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you ca please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fe and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

my nce..

All,
             Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

                 The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft
concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here.
Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
             Page 206 of 402

                    I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
 Page 207 of 402

                    [ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
 Page 208 of 402

                    We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaUonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There
are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18
wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluUon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
 Page 209 of 402

                    Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
 Page 210 of 402

                    They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )- -
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

To: LeAnn Quinn, City Official at Cedar Park TX
Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below
Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Page 214 of 402

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 16:46:00 Central Standard Time
 Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

I hope you will accept my apology in this regards.

Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:
----
SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and below 75db at night (7 pm to 7 am) with exceptions including "motor vehicle motor" (but not tires or any other parts of the vehicle).
reference: https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=7111
I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are
expert in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know. I was in this field of engineering few years back and may give you all some references.

Can you please reply all to let all know what they mean? Shall my money to HOA makes them liable to provide me with these basic benefits?
Also, it will be great if you can show the meeting-dispositions and conclusions from May-2017 when all residents showed up and mentioned of these concerns, any other meeting-disposition and conclusions with City of Cedar Park where you all have taken these agendas, or any internal meeting-disposition where you have decided anything affirmatively to tackle these concerns.

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise

   HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise
         and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear - - if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Jim has clarified that it is not just HOA, but city may also have its own requirements. Here is his original email (sent 1:1) ... I am sorry, it was my misunderstanding.
Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

           me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the
conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th- 2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around
  Page 222 of 402

           with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cann please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET m family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fen and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road
of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc)

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the
raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
           Page 228 of 402

                   We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
 Page 229 of 402

                   Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaUonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or
 Page 230 of 402

walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or
                   slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluUon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe
journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek
elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in,
but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20
vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
 Page 231 of 402

                   - The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept
different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
 Page 232 of 402

                   Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

 I really am sorry for calling you 'Sara'. I always remains a bit confused when it comes to name (for e.g. Sam, but name is Samuel, etc). My intention was not to hurt you. I take this learning forward, and will call all in this email and probably in other places by full names, with Dear, Mr. or Ms. or whatever they prefer to call.

I am not a native English speaker, and many times it becomes a challenge when I ask for things in ways that others feel bad about. I will like to take the opportunity here to reply to all (not just representatives of HOA , but also representatives City, and the engineers, contractors, and anyone in this chain) that:
Please consider this email as my heartfelt apology for using below standards language to show my dissatisfaction in the system. I must have never spoken unkind words even if you were not performing your duties correctly. It is just not right and I am sorry for my language.

Can you please represent the owner of property to follow-up "in-writing" with City about the 3 major concerns.
You must specifically ask about in-writing response to collect their standing, when were the last tests done, what are the calculations and data of safety, noise, and env. protection.
City's own SAFETY Standards, City's own NOISE standards and City's own ENV. PROTECTION standards. The sections of the standards are marked in my email. The city poses to the world that they comply to their own standard for the residents.

Christopher:
Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:

SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have

  comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and below 75db at night (7 pm to 7 am) with exceptions including "motor vehicle motor" (but not tires or any other parts of the vehicle).
reference: https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=7111
I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are expert
in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know. I was in this field of engineering few years back and may give you all some references.

You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may- 26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out.

My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively
respond and let me know that city allso has some
bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
    Page 242 of 402

          General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would m likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road
of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right.

               So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want
to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely
decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our
family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the
raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
           Page 248 of 402

                  We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non- revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
 Page 249 of 402

                  [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In
this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaUonale --
 Page 250 of 402

                  Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluUon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in,
but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.

                  - Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept
different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--

                  Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

This is a civil matter, and I want all things in-open and in-writing. I have sent another email today asking the city of cedar park to come with their compliance to their own safety, noise and environmental standards. I want you to follow up (all in writing, will me in CC) to first show the part where HOA is performing the duties they should. If you delegate this to other HOA personnel, then my understanding remains that s/he will keep me in the loop, follow up with city, get their recorded answers, and then discuss on 12/10.

SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before

Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may- 26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative

I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out.

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively
respond and let me know that city allso has some
bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.

          Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road
of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching

           to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want
to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and
     Page 266 of 402

               formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely
decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our
family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the
raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
           Page 268 of 402

                  We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non- revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In
this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
 Page 269 of 402

                  Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaUonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18
 Page 270 of 402

                  wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluUon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in,
but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
 Page 271 of 402

                  - The city and HOA would not accept
different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
 Page 272 of 402

                  Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

Christopher:
Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:
----
SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

 ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and below 75db at night (7 pm to 7 am) with exceptions including "motor vehicle motor" (but not tires or any other parts of the vehicle).
reference: https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=7111
I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are expert in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know. I was in this field of engineering few years back and may give you all some references.

You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may- 26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.

Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements.

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to

         abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Subject: Re: Notice of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
            Page 281 of 402

         I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot).
New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a
masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
               Page 285 of 402

                 -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely
decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our
family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
 Page 286 of 402

                 [ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non- revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
 Page 287 of 402

                 -- RaUonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluUon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar
Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this
road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
 Page 288 of 402

                 - Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
 Page 289 of 402

                 Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

Christopher:
Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:
----
SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and below 75db at night (7 pm to 7 am) with exceptions including "motor vehicle motor" (but not tires or any other parts of the vehicle).
reference: https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=7111
I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are expert in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know. I was in this field of engineering few years back and may give you all some references.

No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Jim has clarified that it is not just HOA, but city may also have its own requirements. Here is his original email (sent 1:1) ... I am sorry, it was my misunderstanding.
Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent
me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any
      Page 297 of 402

         decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

         Hi Sandeep,
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot).
New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

              The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a
masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here.

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
               Page 303 of 402

                 We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely
decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our
family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
 Page 304 of 402

                 [ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non- revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
 Page 305 of 402

                 -- RaUonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluUon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar
Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this
road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
 Page 306 of 402

                 - Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
 Page 307 of 402

                 Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

There was a email from Christopher who is now representing City of Cedar Park TX. I am pasting his email and my reply Christopher:
Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:
----
SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and below 75db at night (7 pm to 7 am) with exceptions including "motor vehicle motor" (but not tires or any other parts of the vehicle).
reference: https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=7111
I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are expert in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know.

b) The residents were all were at your monthly HOA meeting inn May-2017 raising the concerns. HOA was there on the day (May-22,2017) when the city called for meeting. I read the whole concerns.pdf document that I also emailed to city. For period of May-2017 and Oct-2019:

 concern of the residents? Where is the email chain, or mail, or any record to prove.
c) the concern document is shared with many in HOA and City. Nothing has changed from my side.
They were delivered in written format, and I can clarify if the English isn't clear (I am not a native English speaker)

     Jim,
Attached is the whole website of westsidehoa.org (my HOA).
There are sections in Bylaws and CC&R in it that talks of HEALTH, SAFETY, WELFARE OF THE MEMBERS.
Can you please reply all to let all know what they mean? Shall my money to HOA makes them liable to provide me with these basic benefits?
Also, it will be great if you can show the meeting-dispositions and conclusions from May-2017 when all residents showed up and mentioned of these concerns, any other meeting-disposition and conclusions with City of Cedar Park where you all have taken these agendas, or any internal meeting-disposition where you have decided anything affirmatively to tackle these concerns.

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I
was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
    Page 315 of 402

        General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how
bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,

You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot).
New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals). - You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one

             too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
           Page 321 of 402

                We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
 Page 322 of 402

                [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaUonale --
 Page 323 of 402

                Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18
wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluUon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others
pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
 Page 324 of 402

                - The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
 Page 325 of 402

                Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

Sandeep,
The elected president is the member the board tasked with corresponding with homeowners as a means of keeping the communicaUon streamlined. As volunteers, everyone’s Ume is limited and we must maximize the use of Ume in fulfilling our obligaUons.
Not all the members currently serving on the board were in those roles when this mager began, nor is our property manager the same. We need to catch everyone up to speed so we can come to a consensus as a group. That said, this is not an issue well suited for email. Our next meeUng is 12/10 and we can offer you an execuUve meeUng at that Ume. Please confirm your willingness to meet.

All: I am a bit sick, and still cannot reply as promptly as I was doing in past. I am pasting the email that I got( with only selective people in CC) from president of HOA, with my reply to it:
Sara:
a) Why this email now? This email from HOA is 2.5 yrs late.
I have lost confidence in HOA. To gain my confidence, please reply to question-b of this email
b) The residents were all were at your monthly HOA meeting inn May-2017 raising the concerns. HOA was there on the day (May-22,2017) when the city called for meeting. I read the whole concerns.pdf document that I also emailed to city. For period of May-2017 and Oct-2019:
Where are the proofs that HOA worked for safety , security, health and welfare of residents if you or anyone in HOA worked and fought for my rights then I will feel confident that you all will represent the owners correctly. When and with Whom did you (or anyone in HOA) interacted with in city to raise concern of the residents? Where is the email chain, or mail, or any record to prove.
c) the concern document is shared with many in HOA and City. Nothing has changed from my side.
They were delivered in written format, and I can clarify if the English isn't clear (I am not a native English speaker)

The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the
concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out.

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

       Jim,
My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.

       Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

       Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW

I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.

Let me know if you have any objections to this request and / or need more information from me. In case you are not the right person, please redirect this to him/her for the immediate action.
The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more
then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov- 15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here.
Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please. Sandeep Kalra

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
               Page 338 of 402

               -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
 Page 339 of 402

               [ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
 Page 340 of 402

               -- RaUonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise
control. No trees. No polluUon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
 Page 341 of 402

               - The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are
running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the
valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of
    Page 347 of 402

      leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot).

What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure
              Page 349 of 402

       if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and
let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov- 15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a
higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
           Page 353 of 402

              -- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
 Page 354 of 402

              We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaUonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluUon
checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek
elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
 Page 355 of 402

              My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property
line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are
running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
 Page 356 of 402

              They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the
valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

BESIDE JIM (HOA Rep), I am also marking PRESIDENT, VICE-PRESIDENT, SECRETARY, and COMMUNITY DIRECTOR of HOA for getting the answers:
Q-1: Attached with this email is zip of the website (www.westsidehoa.org.zip, all files were backed up using linux tool 'wget and curl' ). I will keenly wait for the roles and responsibilities of HOA in regards to HEALTH, SAFETY, WELFARE OF OWNERS and other terms as mentioned in CC&R and Bylaws. For me, these are owner's rights... and want to know if you think otherwise.
Q-2: Do you keep any records of meetings, emails, and communication. I need the records of last 3 years (Starting Jan-01-2017 till Today).

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my
property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
    Page 362 of 402

     Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov- 15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings.

When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding:
               Page 364 of 402

      - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION - NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov- 15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a
higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
           Page 368 of 402

             -- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City
and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
 Page 369 of 402

             We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaUonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow
down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18
wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluUon
checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
 Page 370 of 402

             Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20
vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
 Page 371 of 402

             Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what
        Page 375 of 402

  paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out.
I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

    Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my
property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov- 15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

         The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th- 2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoUce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
           Page 382 of 402

            We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City
and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In
this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
 Page 383 of 402

            Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaUonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow
down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18
wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluUon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is
the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
 Page 384 of 402

            My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20
vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
 Page 385 of 402

            -- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.

I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40- 50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

   Hi Sandeep,
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Subject: Re: Notice of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the
big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs in GOOGLE LINK as attachment did not work - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

To whom so ever it is concern -
Let me know if you have any objections to this request and / or need more information from me. In case you are not the right person, please redirect this to him/her for the immediate action.
The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
      Page 394 of 402

        So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft
concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th- 2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricSons to enter our property sSll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecUvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raSonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaUon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepUng the deal of just a higher (addiUonal 2 `) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriUng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bugercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acUon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
           Page 396 of 402

           We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraUon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuUon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opUons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaUon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriUng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriUng a non-revokable, and with no statuary- limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ` wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ` at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beger to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaUons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiUonal PE engineers appointed by City. In
this case, we will accept the 8 ` wooden fence only a`er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
 Page 397 of 402

           We will build our own wall. The size(15`) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaUons when we met the city for the first Ume in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is agached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecUon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaUonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenUal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaSons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Sme etc). There
are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaUons based on models developed using mathemaUcs, science and past experiences from similar situaUons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluUon
checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properUes in the similar situaUon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le` as an easement for uUlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiSonal 2 e high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ` wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ` away from the road with no protecUon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 `. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaUonales: [The ironic ones]
 Page 398 of 402

           - By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ` barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20
vision when a 3 to 4 ` high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÜng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeUng with details) that they will give at least 3 ` barrier and retenUon wall to all properUes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesUon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unUl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secUons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaUons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepUng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusUn-City to give part of the land that AusUn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ` margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 `. Max distance is 9 ` from the property line.
 Page 399 of 402

           From fence start to the point the right lane meeSng point: Min is 9 `, and the Max distance is at 10 ` from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 `. Farthest is 20+ `.
