I understand that you are seeking correspondence between your HOA and the City re: traffic safety concerns. Ms. Quinn has processed your request and found no responsive informaQon. Ms. Quinn has personally advised me that she conducted an exhausQve search of the City’s email archiving soSware and found no results with Mr. Denny (denney.james@westsidehoa.org) or any “@westsidehoa.org” email address as the sender/recipient. Stated differently, there is no email correspondence to provide. Aside from email correspondence, my understanding is that the City also does not have any responsive wri]en correspondence or other records matching your search criteria.
As a point of clarificaQon, if I may... The City is not subject to FOIA, the Freedom of InformaQon Act (federal law), but rather the Texas Public InformaQon Act (state law). The concept is the same – to promote transparency in government. In processing requests for informaQon under the Texas Public InformaQon Act, we use the search criteria provided – names, email addresses, dates, subject ma]er, key terms, etc. If the stated search criteria don’t turn up any results – as is the case with your request – there’s simply nothing to be provided. SomeQmes – NOT the case with your request – there are statutory provisions requiring and/or authorizing certain responsive informaQon to be withheld from disclosure. In these cases, we’re required to advise, in wriQng, of the basis for withholding and/or request a determinaQon from the Texas A]orney General, and we’re required to provide a copy of that request to the original ciQzen requestor. Again, this is NOT the case with your request, but I wanted you to know that if there was responsive informaQon that we’re withholding, state law requires us to let you know that we’re either withholding or seeking a determinaQon from the A]orney General.
Again, this is NOT a case of the City exercising discreQon in withholding informaQon responsive to your request. The City’s administraQve offices are located at City Hall, 450 Cypress Creek Rd., Bldg. #1, Cedar Park, Texas 78613. If you are seeking informaQon regarding legal process, causes of acQon, remedies, etc.,
    Page 1 of 1607

 then I recommend you consult an a]orney familiar with the Texas Public InformaQon Act. I/we cannot further advise re: legal ma]ers.
Lastly, I would advise that we receive thousands of public informaQon requests each year, and we process each as quickly as possible, in the order its received, and pursuant to the Texas Public InformaQon Act, i.e. state law. You’re welcome to include our enQre staff on emails, but it won’t yield a different or faster response.

Mr. Michael:
We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:
Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'. Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists
his Roles and Responsibilities?

  Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

      Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Subject: Re: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Darwin,
I am a licensed P.E. and I want to evaluate the drawings for the Anderson mill road adjacent to our home.
Please send me all revisions of the stamped drawings of the road adjacent to my property.
Please call me at5129991426 before coming here to measure the distance of road to our property line.

             Darwin,
Are you available for coming down to the property and show us the 11 S distance that you talked about? Also, Please send a copy of the drawings (or bring it for us to scan it) of the road that shows the claimed distance from my property line.
My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 S from the property line.
Please give me the window when you can be available.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.

              I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).
Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

EXTERNAL email: Exercise cau^on when opening.
Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous
        Page 24 of 1607

    suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus.

I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached

He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any

I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The
      Page 37 of 1607

          esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Subject: Re: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in
     Page 44 of 1607

                  my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the
   Page 45 of 1607

                   outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is
     Page 46 of 1607

doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

1. The name of HOA is ‘westside HOA’.
2. I do not know names of all board members but the leadership is with Mr Denny (denney.james@westsidehoa.org). All I can say is that the official email address has WestsideHOA.org in their email. So, anything coming from them raising concerns and proposed acQons on safety issues etc.
3. Timeframe is Jan-01-2022 Qll Nov-01-2022(both end date included) Feel free to email me if this is sQll not clear

In relaQon to your Public InformaQon Request received by electronic mail on November 8, 2022, the City will need addiQonal clarificaQon in order to conQnue processing your request.
Please clarify and provide:
1. The name of the Homeowner’s AssociaQon you are referencing.
2. The Board Member names.
a. HOA’s are not required to register with the City, therefore we have no record that would idenQfy Board Members by name.
3. A Qmeframe for which you are seeking with a beginning and an ending date.
By providing the above informaQon, this will assist the City with searching for any responsive doucments you are seeking.

Dear Mrs. LeAnn:
I have raised numerous safety concerns to the city of cedar park and to my hoa (buttercup creek) for incoming 18 wheelers passing through with stones, and fuel. I have also requested my HOA to publicly and legally ask the city to work on all such incidents.
With this email, I would like to request you under FOIA to kindly provide me with any/all Requests and concerns that my HOA board or Board members may have asked in writing (or anything legally accepted in court) to the city of cedar park or vice-versa (i.e. from city to HOA) so as to help with increasing safety violations. To narrow down you search please I am okay with only last 10 months of communication (i.e. Jan-1- 2022 till Nov-1-2022).
        Page 58 of 1607

     Also, If you can compile that - If there are such requests made, then what departments worked on it, and what were the actions taken (temporary ones and the permanent ones)
I am also marking CC to JP.LeCompte as they may have worked on any legal requests that were passed by my HOA or their representatives (including board members, lawyers office etc).
Will appreciate the response from you or Mr. JP LeCompte.

I understand that you are seeking correspondence between your HOA and the City re: traffic safety concerns. Ms. Quinn has processed your request and found no responsive informaQon. Ms. Quinn has personally advised me that she conducted an exhausQve search of the City’s email archiving soSware and found no results with Mr. Denny (denney.james@westsidehoa.org) or any “@westsidehoa.org” email address as the sender/recipient. Stated differently, there is no email correspondence to provide. Aside from email correspondence, my understanding is that the City also does not have any responsive wri]en correspondence or other records matching your search criteria.
As a point of clarificaQon, if I may... The City is not subject to FOIA, the Freedom of InformaQon Act (federal law), but rather the Texas Public InformaQon Act (state law). The concept is the same – to promote transparency in government. In processing requests for informaQon under the Texas Public InformaQon Act, we use the search criteria provided – names, email addresses, dates, subject ma]er, key terms, etc. If the stated search criteria don’t turn up any results – as is the case with your request – there’s simply nothing to be provided. SomeQmes – NOT the case with your request – there are statutory provisions requiring and/or
    Page 60 of 1607

 authorizing certain responsive informaQon to be withheld from disclosure. In these cases, we’re required to advise, in wriQng, of the basis for withholding and/or request a determinaQon from the Texas A]orney General, and we’re required to provide a copy of that request to the original ciQzen requestor. Again, this is NOT the case with your request, but I wanted you to know that if there was responsive informaQon that we’re withholding, state law requires us to let you know that we’re either withholding or seeking a determinaQon from the A]orney General.
Again, this is NOT a case of the City exercising discreQon in withholding informaQon responsive to your request. The City’s administraQve offices are located at City Hall, 450 Cypress Creek Rd., Bldg. #1, Cedar Park, Texas 78613. If you are seeking informaQon regarding legal process, causes of acQon, remedies, etc., then I recommend you consult an a]orney familiar with the Texas Public InformaQon Act. I/we cannot further advise re: legal ma]ers.
Lastly, I would advise that we receive thousands of public informaQon requests each year, and we process each as quickly as possible, in the order its received, and pursuant to the Texas Public InformaQon Act, i.e. state law. You’re welcome to include our enQre staff on emails, but it won’t yield a different or faster response.

  Please clarify and provide:
1. The name of the Homeowner’s AssociaQon you are referencing.
2. The Board Member names.
a. HOA’s are not required to register with the City, therefore we have no record that would idenQfy Board Members by name.
3. A Qmeframe for which you are seeking with a beginning and an ending date.
By providing the above informaQon, this will assist the City with searching for any responsive doucments you are seeking.

I have asked this board to act on many occasions and have copied almost all incidents that I have reported, and I have specifically asked this board to raise in writing to the city so that a legal case can be pre prepared. I have asked the reply to this request 2 times in last 2+ months, and after waiting for 2 months I am bound to ask the same using FOIA.
I have some questions and I need the answers. This request is made under FOIA:
[1]- was there any legal request made by this board or board members during the period of jan-01-2022 till nov-01- 2022 that raised the same concerns to the cedar park city.
[2]- was there any legal request made by the city to the board and/or members, during the same period to act on the concerns of the residents of the neighborhood?
[3]- in the case of [1] or [2], was there any action taken by this board?
Please let me know the response in some reasonable days.

I want the statement from Ranger saying "the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around" to be legally verifiable and recorded.
It will help if you can clarify "wash down Anderson Mill Road" .. is this truck cleaning service ? and at what location is this service on Anderson Mill road?

Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware
        Page 102 of 1607

    of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus.

Dear Connie Odom:
While I am still waiting for your official reply, I thought I would help you with the viewing of the videos. For that reason I uploaded not so new videos to youtube. I would like you to confirm if these are playable at your end or not. If yes, we can start uploading more on your request. Alternately, I would like you to open a FTP server for me to upload or better ship a 16GB USB drive that I can load things and give back to you.

The video proofs are all shared links and you may open from any public computer or cell phone. If they do not work for you, I can work to upload them all to youtube for you.

All my emails can also be uploaded to GITHUB so that they can be seen from any public computer. I have sent documents to the Williamson county legal department using github earlier.. they have not reported any issue of being unable to open. In total the proofs are in Gigabyte and cannot be shared as direct zip files.
This intersection and most of the road projects that city engineers developed in the last 30 years *was without any* safety checks. A typical truck entering and exiting the neighborhood crosses at least 50+ houses (or +/- 200 people) and at least crosses 1 elementary school connection road. A written proof from a licensed cedar park city engineer plus the cross validation of the design document can be produced if asked for (here or in court).
This makes me and my family and hundreds of more neighbors susceptible to safety risk. The local HOA and City are not

Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds.

Mr. Jacob:
Can you confirm again with the source?
I want the statement from Ranger saying "the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around" to be legally verifiable and recorded.
It will help if you can clarify "wash down Anderson Mill Road" .. is this truck cleaning service ? and at what location is this service on Anderson Mill road?

Thank you for contacQng us and bringing this ma]er to our a]enQon. We are deeply commi]ed to the safety of Cedar Park residents and diligently work to keep our neighborhood roadways safe.
We have contacted Ranger about this incident and were informed that the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around. Ranger has assured us that the driver’s supervisor has instructed the driver not to uQlize Gaspar in the future.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further quesQons.

   Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3- 4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).

Hi:
(a) I am somehow getting emails bounced from one recipient in this email (codom@wilco.org). Please let me know if this is something internal and I do not need to bother, or its my mistake.
(b) Are you legally working on behalf of the city, wilco, or hoa and why? Are you paid by this entity to represent ?

I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022- Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus.

Dear WBC board members:
I have numerous times raised safety concerns due to 18-wheelers and fuel tankers passing through the neighborhood. Safety is my right and you are there to protect me. I have asked this board to act on many occasions and have copied almost all incidents that I have reported, and I have specifically asked this board to raise in writing to the city so that a legal case can be pre prepared. I have asked the reply to this request 2 times in last 2+ months, and after waiting for 2 months I am bound to ask the same using FOIA.
I have some questions and I need the answers. This request is made under FOIA:
[1]- was there any legal request made by this board or board members during the period of jan-01-2022 till nov-01- 2022 that raised the same concerns to the cedar park city.
[2]- was there any legal request made by the city to the board and/or members, during the same period to act on the concerns of the residents of the neighborhood?
[3]- in the case of [1] or [2], was there any action taken by this board?
Please let me know the response in some reasonable days.

Dear Connie Odom:
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, _cedar park, tx 78613. It is at the intersection of gaspar bend and anderson mill road.
Since the last 4+ years multiple commercial 18-wheelers trucks loaded with stones, and many times with fuel, have crossed the neighborhood. Each entrance to the neighborhood has a "no pass through trucks" sign. They are not allowed in the neighborhood hence they are "unauthorized".
The video proofs are all shared links and you may open from any public computer or cell phone. If they do not work for you, I can work to upload them all to youtube for you. Does youtube work for you? There must be 25+ incidents each year, and in many cases the zoomed up picture will show the license number, etc. In all my reports, I have also mentioned the day and time. All my emails can also be uploaded to GITHUB so that they can be seen from any public computer. I have sent documents to the Williamson county legal department using github earlier.. they have not reported any issue of being unable to open. In total the proofs are in Gigabyte and cannot be shared as direct zip files.
This intersection and most of the road projects that city engineers developed in the last 30 years *was without any* safety checks. A typical truck entering and exiting the neighborhood crosses at least 50+ houses (or +/- 200 people) and at least crosses 1 elementary school connection road. A written proof from a licensed cedar park city engineer plus the cross validation of the design document can be produced if asked for (here or in court).
This makes me and my family and hundreds of more neighbors susceptible to safety risk. The local HOA and City are not acting on it. They are not open to work while holding the position that they fought for in elections and to serve..They may be purposefully hurting people if they are not acting on it and that is what it looks like to me now after chasing it for years and seeing 0 results. I will be requesting communication between HOA and City under FOIA and send you the response to FOIA once I file it with the city.
I am open to emails, have recorded zoom meetings with you, upload proofs to any public site - youtube, github, google-shared drive, etc. Please let me know what works for you.

When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids.

 Here is one truck today(Oct-04-2022): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPaNjeytHNnIpMsTSblggkizoGh896Di/view? usp=sharing
This is 18 wheeler Ranger Truck loaded with rocks. A small accident from this truck is enough to kill any resident on the spot.
Another incident: 2 weeks back a truck that passed our neighborhood dropped pebbles on the way. The stones are spread all through Gaspar bend, Steven Ct., Lauren Trail, and Nelson loop (and may be more places in the neighborhood). The stones are still lying on the road and no one is cleaning them. Look around, especially the curves where the truck took turns *such as the intersection of Anderson mill and Gaspar, intersection of Gaspar and Steven Ct, etc.
One such pebble has once caused serious damage to my fence as a speeding car just converted it to a projectile. The fense tore by the impact, and you can still visit to see the damage. This was in 2017 or 2018 and even after writing (with photo proof) to city engineers, and no-one showed up. I am still waiting here (year 2022). Imagine some person standing and got hit by that stone.
I think that the Cedar Park City and This HOA must exchange some mails/emails through their lawyers to finalize 'who will be liable' if these incidents carry on and one day cause a loss of life or even cause an accident. Will the city pay or HOA will pay to the person impacted. Do let me know if either party needs proof that these incidents happened or not. I will help to
my fullest with the recordings.

   Here is one truck today(Oct-04-2022): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPaNjeytHNnIpMsTSblggkizoGh896Di/view? usp=sharing
This is 18 wheeler Ranger Truck loaded with rocks. A small accident from this truck is enough to kill any resident on the spot.
Another incident: 2 weeks back a truck that passed our neighborhood dropped pebbles on the way. The stones are spread all through Gaspar bend, Steven Ct., Lauren Trail, and Nelson loop (and may be more places in the neighborhood). The stones are still lying on the road and no one is cleaning them. Look around, especially the curves where the truck took turns *such as the intersection of Anderson mill and Gaspar, intersection of Gaspar and Steven Ct, etc.
One such pebble has once caused serious damage to my fence as a speeding car just converted it to a projectile. The fense tore by the impact, and you can still visit to see the damage. This was in 2017 or 2018 and even after writing (with photo proof) to city engineers, and no-one showed up. I am still waiting here (year 2022). Imagine some person standing and got hit by that stone.
I think that the Cedar Park City and This HOA must exchange some mails/emails through their lawyers to finalize 'who will be liable' if these incidents carry on and one day cause a loss of life or even cause an accident. Will the city pay or HOA will pay to the person impacted. Do let me know if either party needs proof that these incidents happened or not. I will help to
my fullest with the recordings.

Dear Cedar Park City Council:
Lately I am again seeing Ranger trucks out here in the neighborhood. I am marking you in "TO" and CPPD in CC, as I think the onus is more on Council here.
I see that your mission and charter statements both mention "public safety", so please act on this request. Kindly block all heavy vehicles from taking neighborhood roads.
There are kids, pedestrians, and many more that are at risk.
I will also request HOA to start thinking about installing private entrance gates with some electronic fobs at all entrances and exits if the situation is not solvable otherwise.
I can send video proofs if you want. I just witnessed one right now (Friday MArch -25, @5:32PM CST). This is the 3rd incident I have seen in the last 2 weeks.

Dear Mrs. LeAnn:
I have a few requests under FOIA (and maybe Mr. JP. LeCompte can help here, so sending him in case he will like to directly respond).
1. I would like to know the government institutes that legally oversights the following - the work,
- the conduct, and
- the fundings of projects,
w.r.t the public engineering work performed by Engineers at Cedar Park city.
I understand that these maybe 3 different institutes, or just 1. I kindly request all 3 points. Also, Kindly provide me with the link and detail of the communication with them.
2. I also have a secondary question. The taxes are collected by the county and that funds partly or fully the operations, but operations are performed by the city. What is the role of the County in these engineering decisions? Are they part of oversight in operations such as public engineering work?
A simple pointer to some docs or webpage on this 2nd question will help clarify my doubts. ---

Hi,
I have to come to know that Cedar Park Council conducts every month meetings with HOA reps where homeowners are not invited (or cannot join). I will like to access Minutes of meetings from the last 3.5 years where my HOA (Buttercup creek) is involved in such meetings as I want to find the discussion on some of the topics that i have raised through them.

Mr. Denney.
Your points are invalid.
Let me explain a bit. I do not have to declare volunteership to show my affection to neighbors or neighbors. I emailed you all that trucks are unlawfully entering the neighborhood. Who acted on it?
I dealt with the city single handed while you all were not ready to send city stern/strong legal messages or CPPD to act on it. Leave that, there was no email to raise concern or involvement of any one of you sitting there or these 3 newcomers to take up these concerns with neighbors.
Same goes with City violations that happened right on my property with one neighbor being the city and their road. None of you (HOA, not personal) took any action. I am fighting not only for me, but for all living on Lakeline rd. I have been in advanced talks with different national level government agencies and also planning to take it with President Biden's office. What is this if not volunteering ?
Same goes with your book keepings. I pointed out that your hired company is not keeping clean books, and there is a chance of pointing fingers. What did any of these other volunteers or sitting current board members do? What actions were taken? Where is the MOM with resolution to all this? Why are you pointing one finger to me when 3 are pointing back to you all?
I can come to meetings and I will say these again. What will volunteering officially do if my unofficial volunteering is of 0 value to this board?
Also, let me tell you one more thing. This is specific to you Mr. Denney. You are posting to me all the different reasons for one thing or the other.
Examples from your reasonings of past:
- why HOA can increase annual fee when there is $14M surplus in bank? because " other HOA has increased it too"
- "On making Border walls" you said in the meeting "HOA cannot work for individual property because it is only for the
welfare of all properties".
- and now this, "volunteering is the first step to HOA leadership roles" ..
NONE of these arguments are legal and not rules. YOU are MAKING it up and imposing on me! Send me legal docs that show these rules are there for which HOA was formed!
And lastly, what if for some unfortunate reason (covid, accidents, personal problems, etc) the sitting HOA board or volunteers are no longer with HOA? Will this mean that now there is no HOA because no one is qualified to take leadership positions?

My point Sandeep is that you and your 11th graders have yet to volunteer to do anything posiQve for our neighborhood. All I have ever seen from you are complaints and venom. The fact that these people are showing up to meeQngs and volunteering their Qme already makes them much more qualified than someone who constantly complains without offering soluQons.
The chat funcQon in meeQngs is a way to object to anything you hear in meeQngs and offers a wri]en record. The chat funcQon also it is available throughout the meeQng and we actually stop meeQng to answer quesQons. Your statement below is not accurate.
We volunteer our Qme and the last thing we want to do is parQcipate in an arguing match with a homeowner or have a homeowner constantly interrupt meeQngs. Any homeowner who wants to meet individually with with board is more than welcome to schedule a meeQng, where during that Qme, they can air their grievances or concerns.
This system of meeQngs works for us during the pandemic but I assure you we will all be greaÑul to return to normal soon.

The participation in these meetings is not a qualification to take up a role that needs real spine to talk to city, district and legal departments. My 11th grader and his friends will participate next. What will that bring?
Moreover, I did show up in a few meetings earlier even when you were not there. The meetings are not two way communication.
The zoom controller mutes anyone and does not allow them to object to things as they proceed. Only QA is taken when most of the people are left.
Even f2f meetings when they were conducted were not that way.

Had you have shown up to any of the meeQngs this year, maybe you would have met Cheryl, Jason or Andrew. They have all stepped in as replacements for board members who have stepped down. There are 3 open posiQons and these people are the only homeowners who have stepped up to volunteer. If you would like to ask them quesQons, please forward them to me and I will ensure that they receive the quesQons but they are under no obligaQon to answer your quesQons and if you do not like that, then don't vote or write in a candidate.
Also your comment about SaraMarie is quite obtuse. She did more for this community than almost any other homeowner or board member previous to her or since. If you have a personal vende]a against her it would be best to keep that to yourself in future communicaQons or you will be ignored and blocked. I will not tolerate personal a]acks on board members or homeowners.

Please create temp-emails within the board email server and share it by tomorrow to all residents or post them somehow (I do not care). A 10+ day window to ask questions and clarification are required. I need transparency. And when it comes to JD they must have some set guidelines to what they work on. Otherwise someone like Sarah Marie who was representing us can just show a spineless answer saying that the work is outside the reach of her position.
I don't even know what biodata they have shared with you. How can I judge them and vote for one?

FYI All:
I fully and loudly reject any director or HOA positions chosen this non democratic way that seems mostly illegal. I have voted myself(+my wife, and one neighbor) to block my vote or vote for anyone of the 3 candidates.. and can revisit if things change. This is blind-dart game in this HOA which is anyways running as a monopoly. Please reconsider and modify the voting methods. I do not accept any candidature unless then.

I am not here to select a director by playing blind-dart games. and I am not asking for personal emails either.
Please create temp-emails within the board email server and share it by tomorrow to all residents or post them somehow (I do not care). A 10+ day window to ask questions and clarification are required. I need transparency. And when it comes to JD they must have some set guidelines to what they work on. Otherwise someone like Sarah Marie who was representing us can just show a spineless answer saying that the work is outside the reach of her position.
I don't even know what biodata they have shared with you. How can I judge them and vote for one?

We received this Hotline Complaint from you regarding allegaQons that the City of Cedar Park is “building roads without any safety calculaQons”. However, there was nothing to support any of the allegaQons or your claims.
What type of “safety calculaQons” are not being done by the City of Cedar Park?
[SandeepK] The city engineers, and contract firms decided to pull the road next to residents property (earlier the distance was 35ft + walkway of 7 feet, and now at some point as close as 11 feet with only safety of a 6 inch curb. City also removed 50+ yrs old trees that were also acting as protection) but did not follow PE guidelines and did "no"(none, zero) engineering safety calculation as per TBPE guidelines (Proof: https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/enf_pub.pdf, section 1001.003, 137.33 e, and lookup word "calculations") such as what kind of vehicle and what speed is safe for this kind of structure. They were supposed to use physics, and maths to do safety calculations. Instead they only did "accounting estimates" and posted them against estimates. One of the sides of the road is open to winds as it faces BCCP land and there is no structure there. YouTube is filled
     Page 190 of 1607

with videos such as these (one such Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG22JlcZnMk) that shows that high wind will make 18 wheelers fly. With no barrier, or gap between property and road except walkway a high wind can cause catastrophe to pedestrians.
I also pointed out that the 18 wheelers had in the past converted a pebble on the road as a vehicle to destroy a brand new installed fence(proof attached as screen shot). Email to city engineers showed with picture proof how a pebble from a speeding truck tore the wooden fence. There could have been a kid in that spot.
A drunk driver on a truck also is a moving missile. I hope you do not want proof of this. You can fetch thousands of reports from any police department.
Video proof of such trucks travelling unlawfully in the locality (some caring fuel). Unfortunately the angle of installation fails to capture incoming traffic and mostly capture outgoing:

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof. For proof sake i am attaching just one of the email threads. They go really long.
                        Page 191 of 1607

   Page 192 of 1607

  The earlier distance between walkway to road distance would have prevented any of these 3 cases. A new structure was implemented when I raised the concerns in writing (concerns.pdf, proof attached) with all these points raised. Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allegaQons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Page 193 of 1607

Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calculaQons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
What acQon do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allegaQons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road.
2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place. 5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.
In order for us to consider these claims, please provide any supporQng informaQon or documentaQon. Thank you,

    Hi FHWA,
I have been recommended by DOT.gov to send this info to FHWA Tx Division instead. Please find the email with the details below. I am not sure if this comes
under the whistleblower act or not, but it is serious matter as it impacts life of a lot of Americans on the road.
I recommend you to look into the matter, and if there were no studies done, then do some to see if decisions such as these are impacting or not.

DescripQon of the fraud, waste, and/or abuse:
Fraud & Abuse of powers - This may apply to a lot of US ciQes in Texas, but certainly my city - Cedar Park TX (78613) is one, and the Qmeframe of the abuse menQoned here goes in YEARS *25+ years*.
The city engineers have been building roads without any safety calculaQons. They outsource drawings from other firms where also there are no safety calculaQons done. City engineers (Licensed and unlicensed combined) do not push the firms to do the calculaQons.
T.B.P.E (Texas Board of PE Engineers) was contacted in this respect too, but they said that they cannot rule over decisions made by city P.E. engineers. This has been happening from last 25+ years in Cedar Park. From the sense of interacQon with city and TBPE it seems not wrong to assume that this has been pracQce in a lot texas ciQes. (Cannot say for sure for other ciQes - but they were not surprised by the learnings). On asking for calculaQons, city provided me with what Engineers has been submiÄng as "calculaQons" and "esQmates" and it was actually "accounQng calculaQons". Cedar Park TX is just 20 miles from AusQn capital. You can extrapolate to see what is the level of engineering fraud going on.
All data menQoned by me above here is backed by FOIA, and wri]en communicaQon with TBPE, Cedar Park City Council, Cedar Park City Engineers. I can present my data if needed. More so, the cedar park city has not indicated to me that they will take any acQon w.r.t this.
I as a student am also interested in running Machine learning regression algo. to find the correlaQon but could not find dataset on your website NHSTA w.r.t. any accident studies done where the correlaQon to this parameters were studied. I will equally be interested in finding the data to run models myself (if anything or this sort was collected earlier). In case there is data available, then i will like to see that data.

On what type of roads or projects are these allegaQons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.

6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.
In order for us to consider these claims, please provide any supporQng informaQon or documentaQon. Thank you,

    Hi FHWA,
I have been recommended by DOT.gov to send this info to FHWA Tx Division instead. Please find the email with the details below. I am not sure if this comes

Fraud & Abuse of powers - This may apply to a lot of US ciQes in Texas, but certainly my city - Cedar Park TX (78613) is one, and the Qmeframe of the abuse menQoned here goes in YEARS *25+ years*.
The city engineers have been building roads without any safety calculaQons. They outsource drawings from other firms where also there are no safety calculaQons done. City engineers (Licensed and unlicensed combined) do not push the firms to do the calculaQons.
T.B.P.E (Texas Board of PE Engineers) was contacted in this respect too, but they said that they cannot rule over decisions made by city P.E. engineers. This has been happening from last 25+ years in Cedar Park. From the sense of interacQon with city and TBPE it seems not wrong to assume that this has been pracQce in a lot texas ciQes. (Cannot say for sure for other ciQes - but they were not surprised by the learnings). On asking for calculaQons, city provided me with what Engineers has been submiÄng as "calculaQons" and "esQmates" and it was actually "accounQng calculaQons". Cedar Park TX is just 20 miles from AusQn capital. You can extrapolate to see what is the level of engineering fraud going on.
All data menQoned by me above here is backed by FOIA, and wri]en communicaQon with TBPE, Cedar Park City Council, Cedar Park City Engineers. I can present my data if needed. More so, the cedar park city has not indicated to me that they will take any acQon w.r.t this.
I as a student am also interested in running Machine learning regression algo. to find the correlaQon but could not find dataset on your website NHSTA w.r.t. any accident studies done where the correlaQon to this parameters were studied. I will equally be interested in finding the data to run models myself (if anything or this sort was collected earlier). In case there is data available, then i will like to see that data.

We received this Hotline Complaint from you regarding allegaQons that the City of Cedar Park is “building roads without any safety calculaQons”. However, there was nothing to support any of the allegaQons or your claims.
What type of “safety calculaQons” are not being done by the City of Cedar Park?
[SandeepK] The city engineers, and contract firms decided to pull the road next to residents property (earlier the distance was 35ft + walkway of 7 feet, and now at some point as close as 11 feet with only safety of a 6 inch curb. City also removed 50+ yrs old trees that were also acting as protection) but did not follow PE guidelines and did "no"(none, zero) engineering safety calculation as per TBPE guidelines (Proof: https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/enf_pub.pdf, section 1001.003, 137.33 e, and lookup word "calculations") such as what kind of vehicle and what speed is safe for this kind of structure. They were supposed to use physics, and maths to do safety calculations. Instead they only did "accounting estimates" and posted them against estimates. One of the sides of the road is open to winds as it faces BCCP land and there is no structure there. YouTube is filled with videos such as these (one such Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG22JlcZnMk) that shows that high wind will make 18 wheelers fly. With no barrier, or gap between property and road except walkway a high wind can cause catastrophe to pedestrians.
I also pointed out that the 18 wheelers had in the past converted a pebble on the road as a vehicle to destroy a brand new installed fence(proof attached as screen shot). Email to city engineers showed with picture proof how a pebble from a speeding truck tore the wooden fence. There could have been a kid in that spot.
A drunk driver on a truck also is a moving missile. I hope you do not want proof of this. You can fetch thousands of reports from any police department.
Video proof of such trucks travelling unlawfully in the locality (some caring fuel). Unfortunately the angle of installation fails to capture incoming traffic and mostly capture outgoing:

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof. For proof sake i am attaching just one of the email threads. They go really long.
                       Page 207 of 1607

      Page 208 of 1607

   The earlier distance between walkway to road distance would have prevented any of these 3 cases. A new structure was implemented when I raised the concerns in writing (concerns.pdf, proof attached) with all these points raised. Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been
Page 209 of 1607

involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
 What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allegaQons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calculaQons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
What acQon do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allegaQons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid possible
  Page 210 of 1607

casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road. 2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place. 5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.

There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calculaQons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
What acQon do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allegaQons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road.
2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place.
   Page 218 of 1607

5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.
In order for us to consider these claims, please provide any supporQng informaQon or documentaQon. Thank you,

I have been recommended by DOT.gov to send this info to FHWA Tx Division instead. Please find the email with the details below. I am not sure if this comes
under the whistleblower act or not, but it is serious matter as it impacts life of a lot of Americans on the road.
I recommend you to look into the matter, and if there were no studies done, then do some to see if decisions such as these are impacting or not.

DescripQon of the fraud, waste, and/or abuse:
Fraud & Abuse of powers - This may apply to a lot of US ciQes in Texas, but certainly my city - Cedar Park TX (78613) is one, and the Qmeframe of the abuse menQoned here goes in YEARS *25+ years*.
The city engineers have been building roads without any safety calculaQons. They outsource drawings from other firms where also there are no safety calculaQons done. City engineers (Licensed and unlicensed combined) do not push the firms to do the calculaQons.
T.B.P.E (Texas Board of PE Engineers) was contacted in this respect too, but they said that they cannot rule over decisions made by city P.E. engineers. This has been happening from last 25+ years in Cedar Park. From the sense of interacQon with city and TBPE it seems not wrong to assume that this has been pracQce in a lot texas ciQes. (Cannot say for sure for other ciQes - but they were not surprised by the learnings). On asking for calculaQons, city provided me with what Engineers has been submiÄng as "calculaQons" and "esQmates" and it was actually "accounQng calculaQons". Cedar Park TX is just 20 miles from AusQn capital. You can extrapolate to see what is the level of engineering fraud going on.
All data menQoned by me above here is backed by FOIA, and wri]en communicaQon with TBPE, Cedar Park City Council, Cedar Park City Engineers. I can present my data if needed. More so, the cedar park city has not indicated to me that they will take any acQon w.r.t this.
I as a student am also interested in running Machine learning regression algo. to find the correlaQon but could not find dataset on your website NHSTA w.r.t. any accident studies done where the correlaQon to this parameters were studied. I will equally be interested in finding the data to run models myself (if anything or this sort was collected earlier). In case there is data available, then i will like to see that data.

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have
                 Page 223 of 1607

   been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last
25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
         Page 224 of 1607

   I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

     sorry I sent an email too soon. I wanted to add this
There were some end-results from the communication with some teams (though not very fruitful)
[1] BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2] TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3] In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.
[4] Engineers have verbally confessed that the safety on the property is less than other 9 properties. and without commitment said If they have resources then they may try to fix things.

Dear Sir/Madam:
   Page 227 of 1607

      I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side
 Page 228 of 1607

      but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20A
ssessment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

[2] In 2022, President Biden is rolling out infrastructure bill and will do road expansion. I plan to raise my voice in international forums once more if the engineers and compliance people from Texas are going to join because I genuinely believe that they will not a justice to service of America.

Mr. Sam:
Thanks for the clarificaQon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?
ArQcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or a]ached to the motor vehicle.
         Page 230 of 1607

   o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Qres on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaQons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
I am not a legal expert and I will try geÄng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.
I am available mostly on Fridays aSer 2:00 PM. I will only come if the session is fully recorded (Audio and Video) that I will also get access to it, and will like to know the parQcipant's name 2 days before hand.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayQme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) NighÄme: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
     The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise
 Page 233 of 1607

     level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
      So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides
 Page 236 of 1607

    (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov- 15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on
this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of
               Page 238 of 1607

       just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
 Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current
Page 239 of 1607

       Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar
situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe
journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as
 Page 240 of 1607

       close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind
enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let
us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were
 Page 241 of 1607

       taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight,
etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
           Page 245 of 1607

  Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the
   Page 248 of 1607

     project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Asse
ssment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10
   Page 249 of 1607

     families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

Mr. Sam:
Thanks for the clarificaQon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?
ArQcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or a]ached to the motor vehicle.
         Page 250 of 1607

  o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Qres on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaQons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
I am not a legal expert and I will try geÄng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.
I am available mostly on Fridays aSer 2:00 PM. I will only come if the session is fully recorded (Audio and Video) that I will also get access to it, and will like to know the parQcipant's name 2 days before hand.

· Secondly, I need to tell you that the City’s Noise RegulaQons, specifically, ArQcle 8.008.005 (3) grant an exempQon to sounds produced by motor vehicles in the public right-of-way (e.g. Anderson Mill Rd). See verbiage from the city’s ordinance below:
ArQcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound producing equipment within the motor vehicle or a]ached to the motor vehicle.
o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Qres on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaQons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
· And Lastly, regarding your complaint about the air contaminants coming from Anderson Mill Rd onto your property exceeding the City’s Environmental Standards Ordinance ArQcle 8.12, I need to inform you that these regulaQons apply to air contaminants generated by uses within properQes or “zoning districts” around the City and the thresholds are measured at the property boundary. These regulaQons do not apply to public roadways, except during the construcQon of such public roadways.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayQme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) NighÄme: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
      Page 253 of 1607

    Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this
property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
               Page 254 of 1607

  And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a
masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
                  Page 256 of 1607

      -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier
 of 3 S at the roadside.
Page 257 of 1607

      of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family
 Page 258 of 1607

      will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
 Page 259 of 1607

      They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

 Dear Ms. Gloria,

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to
the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk
away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and
          Page 263 of 1607

 more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

sorry I sent an email too soon. I wanted to add this
There were some end-results from the communication with some teams (though not very fruitful)
[1] BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2] TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3] In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.
[4] Engineers have verbally confessed that the safety on the property is less than other 9 properties. and without commitment said If they have resources then they may try to fix things.

I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a
   Page 266 of 1607

    road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Assess
ment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.

Subject: Re: Noise Complaints from Anderson Mill Rd.
Mr. Sam:
Thanks for the clarificaQon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?
ArQcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or a]ached to the motor vehicle.
o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Qres on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaQons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
          Page 268 of 1607

 I am not a legal expert and I will try geÄng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.
I am available mostly on Fridays aSer 2:00 PM. I will only come if the session is fully recorded (Audio and Video) that I will also get access to it, and will like to know the parQcipant's name 2 days before hand.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayQme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) NighÄme: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.

   A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
               Page 272 of 1607

 I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient. -- Decision --
                  Page 274 of 1607

     We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX)
and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
 [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to
Page 275 of 1607

     [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
 Page 276 of 1607

     My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
 Page 277 of 1607

     -- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

I worked with BCCP to see if there were any wrongdoings and they found nothing, so I will be submitting my request in the coming few days.
But before I do so, I will like to clarify why I was investigating engineers' wrongdoing w.r.t BCCP too.
Wildlife has no representation other than us. The City and Engineers decided to construct a major artery road next to wildlife here. All of us know that a drunk driver has an equal chance of entering with a 18 wheeler into wildlife, and noise+pollution will drastically affect wildlife too. A notice or permit may have forced BCCP, Lawmakers and City Engineers to study the situation and maybe look for mitigating some problems we will soon see in the next few decades. That never happened. Now BCCP officials are okay to overlook this (probably they cannot do much, similar to TBPE that cannot act on city engineers).
We combined our responsibilities for the preservation of the wildlife and somehow everyone has neglected it to the extent that they can.
Do you know what will happen just outside this BCCP land in the next 2 to 3 years. The land at 1431 and Anderson-mill road intersection is sold to HEB and AMAZON to make huge mega warehouses. Trucks will run 7x24. AMAZON has already started rolling out things that will make them the savior of wildlife.

I may leave this place in the next 2 or 3 years, but the road will not leave. It will sit and kill because of lack of safety, but also because of generated noise and pollution.

Regarding your two quesQons – we are not asking that one prove a negaQve. However, we do understand that a crux of your issue is that a study was not done (absence of a report) and you believe there should have been one. In that case, it would be important for us to understand where the requirement is (if you know) that states a study was required. Is there a city ordinance, or TXDOT requirement, etc. If this is a best-pracQce situaQon rather than a code or ordinance requirement, then that informaQon would be helpful as well.
As for safety issues – No, of course we do not want anything dangerous to happen to anyone and a fatality is absolutely not required for an issue to be reviewed. If you wish to send in informaQon from your wife, that is fine if it as a personal opinion (vs a sealed report) as she is not a PE in Texas and we don’t want to run into sealing / rule issues. Support from specific codes, etc. is helpful . Also any other engineering analyses or info you might have would be helpful.
You noted the BCCP requirements. Is this for the roadway or power poles, etc? It would be helpful to understand this piece as well. Is the contenQon basically that the city was required to do a BCCP permit for the road itself?
One final comment – since a complaint is against a specific engineer, please provide your informaQon in the context of what that engineer did or was responsible for. For example, if a design error was made, point out how you think that engineer was related to the error. If a study was not done, how was the engineer responsible, etc. This will help with specifying potenQal violaQons.
I appreciate your assistance in these ma]ers. Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Lance.
Thanks for the email and I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs
I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following:
1. You said - "Hunches, speculaQon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an "absence of necessary safety calculaQons" to produce a safe design?
        Page 283 of 1607

  Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not pracQce the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculaQons?
a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculaQons done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a le]er to support that without calculaQons the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 S spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?
2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that s/he did consider these at the "design" phase to cater to need of the FEDERAL agency here. What shall I be asking them to produce?
I am attaching specific slides from BCCP presentation

As we have previously discussed, we can provide some guidance on filing a complaint and what is needed and helpful to have a complaint move forward. I’d be happy to assist.
   Page 285 of 1607

   A couple of things to note at the start – I cannot file the complaint for you; you’ll need to complete the appropriate form and submit any evidence you have. Also, by providing this guidance it does not mean that we are for or against any party in a complaint, nor does it infer that we will find in favor or against any parQcular person or enQty as part of a case. We can open a case per our laws and rules and we will processes it to its appropriate conclusion.
That being said, you noted that you wish to proceed with a complaint against the design engineer. For any complaint, we need to meet a few parQcular thresholds: a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potenQal violaQons should be as specific as possible; the potenQal violaQons must be related to the pracQce of professional engineering; and there must be supporQng evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdicQon to invesQgate or take acQon and if there is a potenQal violaQon to more forward with.
To go through these a bit more:
Rule or Law violaQons: please list the rules you think this individual may have violated. You don’t need to be an a]orney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direcQon on why you think this person did something wrong. In addiQon, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specificaQon, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules – please note that. For example, if you think a person did not follow a naQonal design specificaQon or guidance, please let us know which one(s). For contrast: only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direcQon for an invesQgaQon and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated secQon XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of AusQn’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
The rule or law violaQons should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad. For example, a design plan that has errors that you can idenQfy and is signed by a specific PE may be a violaQon, but a general accusaQon that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that informaQon.
A violaQon must be related to the pracQce of professional engineering. This determines if the board has jurisdicQon to pursue the complaint. A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal acQon and should be handled by the police. On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their pracQce of professional engineering.
The last piece is evidence: if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can. If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that. If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well. Hunches, speculaQon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an invesQgaQon because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court). In addiQon to this, TBPELS does not go on ‘fishing expediQons’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or enQty and then search for potenQal violaQons. We need somewhere specific to focus. That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.
If we get this kind of informaQon, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdicQon to move forward, and then conQnue with an invesQgaQon.

Thanks
On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaQon and the opQons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re- set the foundaQon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraQon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicQon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicQon, and limitaQons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracQce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesQgaQng allegaQons that a licensed engineer has pracQced engineering in a manner that violates
       Page 289 of 1607

     TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracQce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicQon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicQon over ciQes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicQon that has oversight of its roads, construcQon requirements, ordinances, internal operaQons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcQon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicQon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiQonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiQon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesQgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acQons against a city.
From reviewing the informaQon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraQon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesQgate violaQons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acQons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicQon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcQon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porQon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicQon related to municipaliQes. Our jurisdicQon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiQonal tasks of which you are asking (conducQng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaQon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecQon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracQce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaQons, and esQmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaQons, and engineering esQmates. It does not call out any parQcular kind of plan or esQmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esQmates are generally considered to be the engineering porQon of a materials esQmate, such as quanQQes and grades / specificaQons of different construcQon materials for a project. While the cosQng porQon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracQng and procurement side of things.
 Non-engineers doing a cost esQmate would not necessarily be considered a violaQon of the TEPA or
Page 290 of 1607

     Non-engineers doing a cost esQmate would not necessarily be considered a violaQon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaQons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenQal violaQon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcQng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Qed back to an engineer violaQng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesQgaQng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporQng documentaQon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracQce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menQoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parQcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaQon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesQgate potenQal violaQons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracQce of engineering and in violaQon of TEPA, then we can invesQgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaQon is not sufficient for the Board to take acQon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaQons of TEPA and under the jurisdicQon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaQve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaQon, but please understand that there are restricQons on the jurisdicQon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaQon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaQon needed and focused on possible violaQons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
        There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any
 Page 293 of 1607

       request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2. Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons. Michael Sims, P.E.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)
Do you keep recordings of phone calls?

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:
Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'. Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists his Roles and Responsibilities?

Mr. Kalra:
Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the
           Page 309 of 1607

                    right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Thanks Mr. Lance.
I worked with BCCP to see if there were any wrongdoings and they found nothing, so I will be submitting my request in the coming few days.
But before I do so, I will like to clarify why I was investigating engineers' wrongdoing w.r.t BCCP too.
Wildlife has no representation other than us. The City and Engineers decided to construct a major artery road next to wildlife here. All of us know that a drunk driver has an equal chance of entering with a 18 wheeler into wildlife, and noise+pollution will drastically affect wildlife too. A notice or permit may have forced BCCP, Lawmakers and City Engineers to study the situation and maybe look for mitigating some problems we will soon see in the next few decades. That never happened. Now BCCP officials are okay to overlook this (probably they cannot do much, similar to TBPE that cannot act on city engineers).
We combined our responsibilities for the preservation of the wildlife and somehow everyone has neglected it to the extent that they can.
Do you know what will happen just outside this BCCP land in the next 2 to 3 years. The land at 1431 and Anderson-mill road intersection is sold to HEB and AMAZON to make huge mega warehouses. Trucks will run 7x24. AMAZON has already started rolling out things that will make them the savior of wildlife.

I may leave this place in the next 2 or 3 years, but the road will not leave. It will sit and kill because of lack of safety, but also because of generated noise and pollution.

Regarding your two quesQons – we are not asking that one prove a negaQve. However, we do understand that a crux of your issue is that a study was not done (absence of a report) and you believe there should have been one. In that case, it would be important for us to understand where the requirement is (if you know) that states a study was required. Is there a city ordinance, or TXDOT requirement, etc. If this is a best-pracQce situaQon rather than a code or ordinance requirement, then that informaQon would be helpful as well.
     Page 312 of 1607

 As for safety issues – No, of course we do not want anything dangerous to happen to anyone and a fatality is absolutely not required for an issue to be reviewed. If you wish to send in informaQon from your wife, that is fine if it as a personal opinion (vs a sealed report) as she is not a PE in Texas and we don’t want to run into sealing / rule issues. Support from specific codes, etc. is helpful . Also any other engineering analyses or info you might have would be helpful.
You noted the BCCP requirements. Is this for the roadway or power poles, etc? It would be helpful to understand this piece as well. Is the contenQon basically that the city was required to do a BCCP permit for the road itself?
One final comment – since a complaint is against a specific engineer, please provide your informaQon in the context of what that engineer did or was responsible for. For example, if a design error was made, point out how you think that engineer was related to the error. If a study was not done, how was the engineer responsible, etc. This will help with specifying potenQal violaQons.

Thanks for the email and I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs
I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following: 1. You said - "Hunches, speculaQon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an
"absence of necessary safety calculaQons" to produce a safe design?
Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not pracQce the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculaQons?
a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculaQons done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a le]er to support that without calculaQons the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 S spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?
     2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that

For any complaint, we need to meet a few parQcular thresholds: a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potenQal violaQons should be as specific as possible; the potenQal violaQons must be related to the pracQce of professional engineering; and there must be supporQng evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdicQon to invesQgate or take acQon and if there is a potenQal violaQon to more forward with.
   Page 316 of 1607

  To go through these a bit more:
Rule or Law violaQons: please list the rules you think this individual may have violated. You don’t need to be an a]orney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direcQon on why you think this person did something wrong. In addiQon, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specificaQon, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules – please note that. For example, if you think a person did not follow a naQonal design specificaQon or guidance, please let us know which one(s). For contrast: only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direcQon for an invesQgaQon and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated secQon XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of AusQn’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
The rule or law violaQons should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad. For example, a design plan that has errors that you can idenQfy and is signed by a specific PE may be a violaQon, but a general accusaQon that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that informaQon.
A violaQon must be related to the pracQce of professional engineering. This determines if the board has jurisdicQon to pursue the complaint. A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal acQon and should be handled by the police. On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their pracQce of professional engineering.
The last piece is evidence: if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can. If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that. If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well. Hunches, speculaQon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an invesQgaQon because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court). In addiQon to this, TBPELS does not go on ‘fishing expediQons’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or enQty and then search for potenQal violaQons. We need somewhere specific to focus. That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.
If we get this kind of informaQon, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdicQon to move forward, and then conQnue with an invesQgaQon.
I hope these points are helpful. Sincerely,
Lance Kinney, Ph.D., P.E. ExecuQve Director

Thanks
On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaQon and the opQons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaQon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraQon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicQon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicQon, and limitaQons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracQce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesQgaQng allegaQons that a licensed engineer has pracQced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracQce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicQon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicQon over ciQes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicQon that has oversight of its roads, construcQon requirements, ordinances, internal operaQons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcQon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers
      Page 320 of 1607

    under the jurisdicQon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiQonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiQon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesQgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acQons against a city.
From reviewing the informaQon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraQon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesQgate violaQons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acQons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicQon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcQon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porQon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicQon related to municipaliQes. Our jurisdicQon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiQonal tasks of which you are asking (conducQng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaQon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecQon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracQce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaQons, and esQmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaQons, and engineering esQmates. It does not call out any parQcular kind of plan or esQmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esQmates are generally considered to be the engineering porQon of a materials esQmate, such as quanQQes and grades / specificaQons of different construcQon materials for a project. While the cosQng porQon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracQng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esQmate would not necessarily be considered a violaQon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaQons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenQal violaQon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcQng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Qed back to an engineer violaQng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
 Page 321 of 1607

    For the Board to move forward with invesQgaQng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporQng documentaQon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracQce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menQoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parQcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaQon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesQgate potenQal violaQons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracQce of engineering and in violaQon of TEPA, then we can invesQgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaQon is not sufficient for the Board to take acQon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaQons of TEPA and under the jurisdicQon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaQve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaQon, but please understand that there are restricQons on the jurisdicQon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaQon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaQon needed and focused on possible violaQons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the
complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
        Page 324 of 1607

      2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
   Page 325 of 1607

       I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Mr. Kalra:
Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

      Page 335 of 1607

                Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City
    Page 336 of 1607

                of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.

 Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing
fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are
                Page 343 of 1607

generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low- income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

There were some end-results from the communication with some teams (though not very fruitful)
[1] BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2] TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3] In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.
[4] Engineers have verbally confessed that the safety on the property is less than other 9 properties. and without commitment said If they have resources then they may try to fix things.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
   Page 346 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:01:31 Central Standard Time
    Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all:

    Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft
   Page 352 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:01:35 Central Standard Time
    away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.

Noise Complaints from Anderson Mill Rd..eml.eml, No9ce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything.eml.eml
Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing
fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low- income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
        Page 355 of 1607

Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your
         Page 362 of 1607

  property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places

There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
     Page 365 of 1607

     I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

SecQon 1001.407 TBPE Guide for any license engineer working on "Public Work" must support his work with 3 parts (a) Plan (b) SpecificaQons and (3) EsQmates.
I am asking for the (b) and (c). They must be in your possession from the person who sealed the design plan.

Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your
         Page 370 of 1607

  property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places

There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
     Page 373 of 1607

     I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Dear Mr. Lance.
Thanks for the email and I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs
I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following:
1. You said - "Hunches, speculaQon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an "absence of necessary safety calculaQons" to produce a safe design?
Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not pracQce the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculaQons?
a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculaQons done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a le]er to support that without calculaQons the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 S spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?
2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that s/he did consider these at the "design" phase to cater to need of the FEDERAL agency here. What shall I be asking them to produce?
I am attaching specific slides from BCCP presentation

 Page 378 of 1607

 Good morning Mr. Kalra,
 As we have previously discussed, we can provide some guidance on filing a complaint and what is needed and helpful to have a complaint move forward. I’d be happy to assist.
A couple of things to note at the start – I cannot file the complaint for you; you’ll need to complete the appropriate form and submit any evidence you have. Also, by providing this guidance it does not mean that we are for or against any party in a complaint, nor does it infer that we will find in favor or against any parQcular person or enQty as part of a case. We can open a case per our laws and rules and we will processes it to its appropriate conclusion.
That being said, you noted that you wish to proceed with a complaint against the design engineer. For any complaint, we need to meet a few parQcular thresholds: a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potenQal violaQons should be as specific as possible; the potenQal violaQons must be related to the pracQce of professional engineering; and there must be supporQng evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdicQon to invesQgate or take acQon and if there is a potenQal violaQon to more forward with.
To go through these a bit more:
Rule or Law violaQons: please list the rules you think this individual may have violated. You don’t need to be an a]orney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direcQon on why you think this person did something wrong. In addiQon, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specificaQon, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules – please note that. For example, if you think a person did not follow a naQonal design specificaQon or guidance, please let us know which one(s). For contrast: only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direcQon for an invesQgaQon and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated secQon XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of AusQn’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
The rule or law violaQons should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad. For example, a design plan that has errors that you can idenQfy and is signed by a specific PE may be a violaQon, but a general accusaQon that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that informaQon.
A violaQon must be related to the pracQce of professional engineering. This determines if the board has jurisdicQon to pursue the complaint. A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal acQon and should be handled by the police. On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their pracQce of professional engineering.
The last piece is evidence: if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can. If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that. If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well. Hunches, speculaQon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an invesQgaQon because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court). In addiQon to this, TBPELS does not go on ‘fishing expediQons’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or enQty and then search for potenQal violaQons. We need somewhere specific to focus. That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.
Page 379 of 1607

 If we get this kind of informaQon, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdicQon to move forward, and then conQnue with an invesQgaQon.
I hope these points are helpful. Sincerely,

On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaQon and the opQons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaQon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraQon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicQon to do so.
          Page 382 of 1607

   First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicQon, and limitaQons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracQce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesQgaQng allegaQons that a licensed engineer has pracQced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracQce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicQon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicQon over ciQes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicQon that has oversight of its roads, construcQon requirements, ordinances, internal operaQons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcQon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicQon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiQonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiQon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesQgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acQons against a city.
From reviewing the informaQon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraQon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesQgate violaQons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acQons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicQon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcQon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porQon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicQon related to municipaliQes. Our jurisdicQon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiQonal tasks of which you are asking (conducQng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaQon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecQon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracQce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaQons, and esQmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaQons, and engineering esQmates. It does not call out any parQcular kind of plan or esQmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they
 Page 383 of 1607

   have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esQmates are generally considered to be the engineering porQon of a materials esQmate, such as quanQQes and grades / specificaQons of different construcQon materials for a project. While the cosQng porQon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracQng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esQmate would not necessarily be considered a violaQon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaQons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenQal violaQon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcQng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Qed back to an engineer violaQng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesQgaQng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporQng documentaQon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracQce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menQoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parQcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaQon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesQgate potenQal violaQons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracQce of engineering and in violaQon of TEPA, then we can invesQgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaQon is not sufficient for the Board to take acQon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaQons of TEPA and under the jurisdicQon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaQve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaQon, but please understand that there are restricQons on the jurisdicQon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaQon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaQon needed and focused on possible violaQons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
         Page 386 of 1607

     There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

               The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it
    Page 398 of 1607

               is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:02:07 Central Standard Time
  City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day- 01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

  Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
 I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaQon and the opQons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaQon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraQon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicQon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicQon, and limitaQons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracQce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesQgaQng allegaQons that a licensed engineer has pracQced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracQce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicQon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicQon over ciQes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicQon that has oversight of its roads, construcQon requirements, ordinances, internal operaQons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcQon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicQon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiQonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiQon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesQgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acQons against a city.
From reviewing the informaQon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraQon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesQgate violaQons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acQons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicQon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcQon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is
 responsible for its porQon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicQon related to municipaliQes. Our
Page 407 of 1607

   responsible for its porQon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicQon related to municipaliQes. Our jurisdicQon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiQonal tasks of which you are asking (conducQng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaQon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecQon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracQce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaQons, and esQmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaQons, and engineering esQmates. It does not call out any parQcular kind of plan or esQmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esQmates are generally considered to be the engineering porQon of a materials esQmate, such as quanQQes and grades / specificaQons of different construcQon materials for a project. While the cosQng porQon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracQng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esQmate would not necessarily be considered a violaQon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaQons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenQal violaQon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcQng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Qed back to an engineer violaQng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesQgaQng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporQng documentaQon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracQce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menQoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parQcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaQon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesQgate potenQal violaQons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracQce of engineering and in violaQon of TEPA, then we can invesQgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaQon is not sufficient for the Board to take acQon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
 Page 408 of 1607

   One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaQons of TEPA and under the jurisdicQon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaQve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaQon, but please understand that there are restricQons on the jurisdicQon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaQon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaQon needed and focused on possible violaQons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
     Page 411 of 1607

     I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
  The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are

      referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.

He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.

           If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

SecQon 1001.407 TBPE Guide for any license engineer working on "Public Work" must support his work with 3 parts (a) Plan (b) SpecificaQons and (3) EsQmates.
I am asking for the (b) and (c). They must be in your possession from the person who sealed the design plan.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your

                   property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day- 01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).

There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

Good morning Mr. Lance
I understand your point of view and I have decided to go and ask for invesQgaQon for safety in drawings made by the PE engineers for Anderson Mill Rd expansion project. I know from my past email exchanges with you that TBPE may help me write the request for invesQgaQon. I will like to get some help there in this regards. This may be my first step for asking to fix this crap facade that is built with zero knowledge of safety for travelers and resident.
Please suggest how to go about it. Thanks

           Page 430 of 1607

  I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaQon and the opQons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaQon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraQon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicQon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicQon, and limitaQons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracQce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesQgaQng allegaQons that a licensed engineer has pracQced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracQce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicQon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicQon over ciQes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicQon that has oversight of its roads, construcQon requirements, ordinances, internal operaQons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcQon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicQon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiQonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiQon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesQgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acQons against a city.
From reviewing the informaQon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraQon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesQgate violaQons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acQons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicQon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcQon, and
maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porQon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicQon related to municipaliQes. Our jurisdicQon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiQonal tasks of which you are
 Page 431 of 1607

  asking (conducQng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaQon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecQon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracQce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaQons, and esQmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaQons, and engineering esQmates. It does not call out any parQcular kind of plan or esQmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esQmates are generally considered to be the engineering porQon of a materials esQmate, such as quanQQes and grades / specificaQons of different construcQon materials for a project. While the cosQng porQon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracQng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esQmate would not necessarily be considered a violaQon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaQons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenQal violaQon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcQng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Qed back to an engineer violaQng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesQgaQng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporQng documentaQon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracQce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menQoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parQcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaQon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesQgate potenQal violaQons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracQce of engineering and in violaQon of TEPA, then we can invesQgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaQon is not sufficient for the Board to take acQon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaQons of TEPA and under the jurisdicQon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department
 Page 432 of 1607

   would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaQve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaQon, but please understand that there are restricQons on the jurisdicQon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaQon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaQon needed and focused on possible violaQons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry
    Page 435 of 1607

    so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:
Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'. Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists his Roles and Responsibilities?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be
      Page 446 of 1607

              provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design
       Page 450 of 1607

parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

Thanks
On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaQon and the opQons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaQon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraQon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicQon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicQon, and limitaQons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracQce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesQgaQng allegaQons that a licensed engineer has pracQced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracQce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicQon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering).
  Page 452 of 1607

 The Board also does not have jurisdicQon over ciQes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicQon that has oversight of its roads, construcQon requirements, ordinances, internal operaQons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcQon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicQon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiQonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiQon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesQgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acQons against a city.
From reviewing the informaQon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraQon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesQgate violaQons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acQons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicQon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcQon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porQon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicQon related to municipaliQes. Our jurisdicQon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiQonal tasks of which you are asking (conducQng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaQon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecQon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracQce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaQons, and esQmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaQons, and engineering esQmates. It does not call out any parQcular kind of plan or esQmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esQmates are generally considered to be the engineering porQon of a materials esQmate, such as quanQQes and grades / specificaQons of different construcQon materials for a project. While the cosQng porQon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracQng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esQmate would not necessarily be considered a violaQon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
 Page 453 of 1607

 In your communicaQons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenQal violaQon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcQng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Qed back to an engineer violaQng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesQgaQng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporQng documentaQon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracQce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menQoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parQcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaQon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesQgate potenQal violaQons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracQce of engineering and in violaQon of TEPA, then we can invesQgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaQon is not sufficient for the Board to take acQon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaQons of TEPA and under the jurisdicQon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaQve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaQon, but please understand that there are restricQons on the jurisdicQon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaQon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaQon needed and focused on possible violaQons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make
        Page 456 of 1607

   sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From
   Page 457 of 1607

    my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

       I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

                  Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs
        Page 472 of 1607

                with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub- clauses.

Darwin,
Are you available for coming down to the property and show us the 11 S distance that you talked about? Also, Please send a copy of the drawings (or bring it for us to scan it) of the road that shows the claimed distance from my property line.

My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 S from the property line.
Please give me the window when you can be available.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "

CC: Michael Sims <Michael.Sims@pels.texas.gov>
Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaQon and the opQons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaQon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraQon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicQon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicQon, and limitaQons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracQce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesQgaQng allegaQons that a licensed
   Page 476 of 1607

engineer has pracQced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracQce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicQon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicQon over ciQes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicQon that has oversight of its roads, construcQon requirements, ordinances, internal operaQons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcQon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicQon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiQonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiQon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesQgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acQons against a city.
From reviewing the informaQon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraQon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesQgate violaQons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acQons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicQon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcQon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porQon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicQon related to municipaliQes. Our jurisdicQon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiQonal tasks of which you are asking (conducQng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaQon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecQon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracQce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaQons, and esQmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaQons, and engineering esQmates. It does not call out any parQcular kind of plan or esQmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esQmates are generally considered to be the engineering porQon of a materials esQmate, such as quanQQes and grades / specificaQons of different construcQon materials for a project. While the cosQng porQon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracQng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esQmate would not necessarily be considered a violaQon of the TEPA or Board rules.
 Page 477 of 1607

 The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaQons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenQal violaQon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcQng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Qed back to an engineer violaQng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesQgaQng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporQng documentaQon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracQce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menQoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parQcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaQon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesQgate potenQal violaQons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracQce of engineering and in violaQon of TEPA, then we can invesQgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaQon is not sufficient for the Board to take acQon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaQons of TEPA and under the jurisdicQon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaQve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaQon, but please understand that there are restricQons on the jurisdicQon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaQon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaQon needed and focused on possible violaQons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.
Sincerely,
Lance Kinney, Ph.D., P.E.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects.
       The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing
Page 480 of 1607

  The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

   It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

      We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
    How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

                 Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the
        Page 496 of 1607

               plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

CC: Michael Sims <Michael.Sims@pels.texas.gov>
Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaQon and the opQons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaQon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraQon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicQon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicQon, and limitaQons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracQce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesQgaQng allegaQons that a licensed engineer has pracQced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has
   Page 500 of 1607

engaged in the pracQce of engineering.
 The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicQon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicQon over ciQes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicQon that has oversight of its roads, construcQon requirements, ordinances, internal operaQons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcQon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicQon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiQonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiQon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesQgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acQons against a city.
From reviewing the informaQon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraQon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesQgate violaQons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acQons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicQon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcQon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porQon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicQon related to municipaliQes. Our jurisdicQon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiQonal tasks of which you are asking (conducQng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaQon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecQon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracQce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaQons, and esQmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaQons, and engineering esQmates. It does not call out any parQcular kind of plan or esQmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esQmates are generally considered to be the engineering porQon of a materials esQmate, such as quanQQes and grades / specificaQons of different construcQon materials for a project. While the cosQng porQon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracQng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esQmate would not necessarily be considered a violaQon of the TEPA or Board rules.
Page 501 of 1607

 The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaQons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenQal violaQon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcQng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Qed back to an engineer violaQng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesQgaQng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporQng documentaQon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracQce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menQoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parQcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaQon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesQgate potenQal violaQons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracQce of engineering and in violaQon of TEPA, then we can invesQgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaQon is not sufficient for the Board to take acQon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaQons of TEPA and under the jurisdicQon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaQve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaQon, but please understand that there are restricQons on the jurisdicQon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaQon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaQon needed and focused on possible violaQons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.
Sincerely,
Lance Kinney, Ph.D., P.E. ExecuQve Director

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing
       projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations
Page 504 of 1607

  projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

   It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
 Page 505 of 1607

   I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

      I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
          Page 519 of 1607

               First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway

               distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
  There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

CC: Michael Sims <Michael.Sims@pels.texas.gov>
Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaQon and the opQons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaQon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraQon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicQon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicQon, and limitaQons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracQce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesQgaQng allegaQons that a licensed engineer has pracQced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracQce of engineering.
   Page 524 of 1607

 The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicQon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicQon over ciQes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicQon that has oversight of its roads, construcQon requirements, ordinances, internal operaQons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcQon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicQon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiQonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiQon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesQgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acQons against a city.
From reviewing the informaQon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraQon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesQgate violaQons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acQons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicQon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcQon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porQon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicQon related to municipaliQes. Our jurisdicQon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiQonal tasks of which you are asking (conducQng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaQon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecQon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracQce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaQons, and esQmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaQons, and engineering esQmates. It does not call out any parQcular kind of plan or esQmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esQmates are generally considered to be the engineering porQon of a materials esQmate, such as quanQQes and grades / specificaQons of different construcQon materials for a project. While the cosQng porQon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracQng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esQmate would not necessarily be considered a violaQon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusQn

TransportaQon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaQons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenQal violaQon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcQng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Qed back to an engineer violaQng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesQgaQng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporQng documentaQon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracQce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menQoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parQcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaQon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesQgate potenQal violaQons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracQce of engineering and in violaQon of TEPA, then we can invesQgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaQon is not sufficient for the Board to take acQon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaQons of TEPA and under the jurisdicQon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaQve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaQon, but please understand that there are restricQons on the jurisdicQon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaQon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaQon needed and focused on possible violaQons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.
Sincerely,
Lance Kinney, Ph.D., P.E. ExecuQve Director

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing
       projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations
Page 528 of 1607

  projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

   It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
 Page 529 of 1607

   I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

      I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

               First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway
          Page 544 of 1607

               distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
  There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

CC: Michael Sims <Michael.Sims@pels.texas.gov>
Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaQon and the opQons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaQon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraQon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicQon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicQon, and limitaQons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracQce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesQgaQng allegaQons that a licensed engineer has pracQced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracQce of engineering.
   Page 548 of 1607

 The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicQon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracQce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicQon over ciQes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicQon that has oversight of its roads, construcQon requirements, ordinances, internal operaQons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcQon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicQon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiQonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiQon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesQgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acQons against a city.
From reviewing the informaQon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraQon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesQgate violaQons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acQons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicQon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcQon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porQon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicQon related to municipaliQes. Our jurisdicQon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiQonal tasks of which you are asking (conducQng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaQon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecQon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracQce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaQons, and esQmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaQons, and engineering esQmates. It does not call out any parQcular kind of plan or esQmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esQmates are generally considered to be the engineering porQon of a materials esQmate, such as quanQQes and grades / specificaQons of different construcQon materials for a project. While the cosQng porQon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracQng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esQmate would not necessarily be considered a violaQon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusQn
Page 549 of 1607

TransportaQon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaQons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenQal violaQon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcQng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Qed back to an engineer violaQng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesQgaQng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporQng documentaQon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracQce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusQn TransportaQon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menQoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parQcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaQon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesQgate potenQal violaQons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracQce of engineering and in violaQon of TEPA, then we can invesQgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaQon is not sufficient for the Board to take acQon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaQons of TEPA and under the jurisdicQon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaQve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaQon, but please understand that there are restricQons on the jurisdicQon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaQon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaQon needed and focused on possible violaQons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.
Sincerely,
Lance Kinney, Ph.D., P.E. ExecuQve Director

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing
       projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations
Page 552 of 1607

  projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

   It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
 Page 553 of 1607

   I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.

      I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
          Page 567 of 1607

               First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway
          Page 568 of 1607

               distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
  There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?

  Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:

That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Dear Mr. Michael
This is yet another request or reminder. I am looking for a wri]en results to your invesQgaQon for the case that i raised with concerns of gross negligence by city officials in building the road. I was told that TBPE can not invesQgate because it was Mr. Green who is non PE and has been the engineer in the project. I am marking Mr. Lance in cc here.

      Page 583 of 1607

            Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar
    Page 584 of 1607

            Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult

                    but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S
fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.

I think you are mistaken on the esQmate part.
The context of the clause is on safety, and welfare and I believe the esQmates are also associated to the safety and not to cost.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

I think you are mistaken on the esQmate part.
The context of the clause is on safety, and welfare and I believe the esQmates are also associated to the safety and not to cost.
The state or a political subdivision of the state may not construct a public work involving engineering in which the public h
ealth, welfare,
or safety is involved, unless:
(1) th

Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01.

 Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.

    TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)
Do you keep recordings of phone calls?

Mr. Michael:
We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:
Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'. Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists his Roles and Responsibilities?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and
    Page 625 of 1607

           verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

              kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project
layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an
         Page 650 of 1607

             offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

                   Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon.
The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Hi Darwin,
     Page 655 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:04:50 Central Standard Time
                    I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone
     Page 658 of 1607

 call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who

If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

          Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American
        Page 672 of 1607

             AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Darwin,
I am a licensed P.E. and I want to evaluate the drawings for the Anderson mill road adjacent to our home.
Please send me all revisions of the stamped drawings of the road adjacent to my property.

Darwin,
Are you available for coming down to the property and show us the 11 S distance that you talked about? Also, Please send a copy of the drawings (or bring it for us to scan it) of the road that shows the claimed distance from my property line.
My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 S from the property line.
Please give me the window when you can be available.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
     Page 675 of 1607

                  The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).
Thanks.

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your

                    property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon.
The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
     Page 677 of 1607

                    The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone
     Page 679 of 1607

 call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who

If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

          Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American
        Page 693 of 1607

             AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Subject: Re: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
     Page 696 of 1607

                  The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).
Thanks.

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your

                    property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon.
The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).

                    The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone

 call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

          Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

I am now requesQng you "ALL VERSIONS of ALL DRAWINGs", their respecQve "ESTIMATES or CALCULATIONS" along with their "SPECIFICATIONS" specific to this Anderson Mill expansion project.
Please send all copies to Anderson.Mill.Road@gmail.com. (This is my alias email to hold big files and records).
I am also a]aching in CC a copy of this thread to the AdministraQve and LegislaQve office of Cedar Park ("Mayor of Cedar Park", and "City Secretary").

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American
        Page 714 of 1607

             AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Subject: Re: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
     Page 717 of 1607

                  The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).
Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your

                    property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon.
The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
     Page 719 of 1607

                    The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaQon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecQon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicQon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicQon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracQce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracQce Act or Board rules.
I sQll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracQce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiQonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiQonal communicaQon unQl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
  Page 721 of 1607

 The Board does not have a statute of limitaQons, so I am unclear what Qming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sQll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporQng documentaQon against each individual) and we will begin the invesQgaQon process.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any

I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.

Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
     Page 731 of 1607

          The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Subject: Re: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
     Page 738 of 1607

                  I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).
Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon.
The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway

                    and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.

                    Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right
           Page 754 of 1607

            turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

 Hi Darwin,
                 I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

             Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Mr. Lance:
TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)
Do you keep recordings of phone calls?

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the

            Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Subject: Re: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
        Page 790 of 1607

            There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).
Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is
helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons. Thanks,

                 Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:

his Roles and Responsibilities?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
     Page 808 of 1607

              The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes.

                northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.

                Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Mr. Michael:
We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:
Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'. Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists his Roles and Responsibilities?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
         Page 821 of 1607

         Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the

                Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going

         to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded
without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

     Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub- clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded

     Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub- clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

 Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub- clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Mr. Michael:
We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:

his Roles and Responsibilities?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracQce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracQced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.

           Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
     Page 901 of 1607

              I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).
Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracQce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaQon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiQonal informaQon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded
without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
   The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that
 Page 910 of 1607

     designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

              Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded
without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Subject: Re: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats
to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
  With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

      Alan, Darwin,
  When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats
to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
             I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

AND, at the same Qme, I have this email(attached as PDF, because of the email history) where Mr. Darwin who is represenQng the city engineers is trying to tell me that calculaQons are business-calculaQons and that is how the city has operated from last 20+ years.
Mr. Sam Roberts, P.E. has come forward to clarify my doubts about the noise and polluQon that the structure is now producing was never a responsibility of the city even when written concerns were given to them before the work started, and I may need some assistance from TBPE to cross-examine the facts as and when they are presented to me in the meeQng.
I am hoping that TBPE will accept the request for joining the meeQng.

I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too.

Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?

I am not a legal expert and I will try geÄng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.

· And Lastly, regarding your complaint about the air contaminants coming from Anderson Mill Rd onto your property exceeding the City’s Environmental Standards Ordinance ArQcle 8.12, I need to inform you that these regulaQons apply to air contaminants generated by uses within properQes or “zoning districts” around the City and the thresholds are measured at the property boundary. These regulaQons do not apply to public roadways, except during the construcQon of such public roadways.
In closing, I would like to offer to meet with you to try to answer any quesQons you may have. I will need to include some of the subject ma]er experts such as the engineers who worked on the roadway in such a meeQng.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayQme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) NighÄme: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

BESIDE JIM (HOA Rep), I am also marking PRESIDENT, VICE-PRESIDENT, SECRETARY, and COMMUNITY DIRECTOR of HOA for
getting the answers:
Q-1: Attached with this email is zip of the website (www.westsidehoa.org.zip, all files were backed up using linux tool 'wget and curl' ). I will keenly wait for the roles and responsibilities of HOA in regards to HEALTH, SAFETY, WELFARE OF OWNERS and other terms as mentioned in CC&R and Bylaws. For me, these are owner's rights... and want to know if you think otherwise.
Q-2: Do you keep any records of meetings, emails, and communication. I need the records of last 3 years (Starting Jan-01-2017 till Today).

There are sections in Bylaws and CC&R in it that talks of HEALTH, SAFETY, WELFARE OF THE MEMBERS.
Can you please reply all to let all know what they mean? Shall my money to HOA makes them liable to provide me with these basic benefits?
Also, it will be great if you can show the meeting-dispositions and conclusions from May-2017 when all residents showed up and mentioned of these concerns, any other meeting-disposition and conclusions with City of Cedar Park where you all have taken these agendas, or any internal meeting-disposition where you have decided anything affirmatively to tackle these concerns.

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the
concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

      Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
    Page 972 of 1607

       General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in

            protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more
then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov- 15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
           Page 978 of 1607

               We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
 Page 979 of 1607

               [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
 Page 980 of 1607

               Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise
control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
 Page 981 of 1607

               - The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are
running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the
valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Dear Robert, Kevin and Amber.
You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
                      Page 985 of 1607

 The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
Acoustic Beamforming: Mapping Sources of Truck Noise , link: https://books.google.com/books? id=rDyhc7WhqqIC&pg=PA7&dq=argument+motor+vehicle+motor+sound+is+not+motor+vehicle+tyre+sound&hl=e n&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2uMbW9evmAhUZCs0KHZ9cCjQQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=onepag e&q=argument%20motor%20vehicle%20motor%20sound%20is%20not%20motor%20vehicle%20tyre%20sound&f =false

There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).

 Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:08:24 Central Standard Time
      city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
 Page 989 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:08:25 Central Standard Time
      Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this. Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:08:34 Central Standard Time
       Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:08:35 Central Standard Time
        Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research

There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).

Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
   Page 1018 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:08:44 Central Standard Time
       Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
 Page 1019 of 1607

       Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I
 air as permitted by law of Cedar Park Texas. The
 vegetation next to the Anderson Mill road is getting killed. The photo proof of that was given to the city earlier by purchasing of two
 shrubs of same kind on same day and one planting on Anderson Mill road and other on gaspar bend (planted 10 feet apart, one is
 growing whereas other did not survive) . Is there a way for you to proof that city is in compliance to their own section 8.12.005. A test
 of air quality inside my property line will be highly appreciated.
           Page 1022 of 1607

   guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure.

- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).

I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this. Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
   Page 1032 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:08:53 Central Standard Time
        Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is
in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of
 Page 1033 of 1607

reports.
        Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
Acoustic Beamforming: Mapping Sources of Truck Noise , link: https://books.google.com/books? id=rDyhc7WhqqIC&pg=PA7&dq=argument+motor+vehicle+motor+sound+is+not+motor+vehicle+tyre+sound&hl =en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2uMbW9evmAhUZCs0KHZ9cCjQQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=on epage&q=argument%20motor%20vehicle%20motor%20sound%20is%20not%20motor%20vehicle%20tyre%20s ound&f=false

           Page 1036 of 1607

  There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).

Hi,
I am Deepshikha, Sandeep's wife.
We need to get a 3 S concrete wall for our safety and protecQon. It will be unsafe for us to go to our backyard because of the adjacent road coming up. The traffic will increase and so will the noise polluQon.
If you think the distance from our fence is not enough to build a wall then you can move the fence 1-2 S inside our property line.
Please consider this request as it is a safety concern for our family.
Thanks & Regards, Deepshikha Kalra

I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

 Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

Hi,
I am Deepshikha, Sandeep's wife.
We need to get a 3 S concrete wall for our safety and protecQon. It will be unsafe for us to go to our backyard because of the adjacent road coming up. The traffic will increase and so will the noise polluQon.
If you think the distance from our fence is not enough to build a wall then you can move the fence 1-2 S inside our property line.
Please consider this request as it is a safety concern for our family.
Thanks & Regards, Deepshikha Kalra

I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.
There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).
Ref : Table 3 of book, and AASHTO std is already with you to guide.
https://books.google.com/books?id=cTc3AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA6-PA1&lpg=RA6- PA1&dq=BCCP+Infrastructure+Corridors&source=bl&ots=_Eo3sbzQOK&sig=ACfU3U0A- yfjuqfmPKHpOlkEV1gbKalGdA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi49ciP4ebmAhWJGs0KHYrLANkQ6AEwBnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage& q=BCCP%20Infrastructure%20Corridors&f=false
I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this. Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
            Page 1050 of 1607

  - shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is
        maintained?
Page 1052 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:09:06 Central Standard Time
       maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
 Page 1053 of 1607

      Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

Good luck and Happy New Year
Today I am feeling sad and happy at the same Qme. Sad because Retaliatory acQon from City engineers has started (A]achment below), and Happy because something or someone up above is now making them "fear" of their own in-acQons!

Dear Robert, Kevin and Amber.
You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
Acoustic Beamforming: Mapping Sources of Truck Noise , link: https://books.google.com/books? id=rDyhc7WhqqIC&pg=PA7&dq=argument+motor+vehicle+motor+sound+is+not+motor+vehicle+tyre+sound&hl=e n&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2uMbW9evmAhUZCs0KHZ9cCjQQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=onepag e&q=argument%20motor%20vehicle%20motor%20sound%20is%20not%20motor%20vehicle%20tyre%20sound&f =false

I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.
There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).
Ref : Table 3 of book, and AASHTO std is already with you to guide.

I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this.
Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
   Page 1068 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:09:16 Central Standard Time
      Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
 Page 1069 of 1607

Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

Hi, I live on 201 Gaspar Bend cedar Park tx.
The city of Cedar Park TX expanded the road next to my house (it is on BCCP corridor), and I would like to get the copy of contract and permit to review their construction of expansion of
Anderson Mill road that they did starting May-2017 and ended Aug-2018. I am marking Cedar Park TX official in CC for them to officially know of this request as well.
Before you read below: Please reply all and try to keep all in loop.
Under BCCP, there must be no major construction (major = beyond 3000 sq ft) without permit (ref: Table3 of book mentioned below). Also, any construction should have maintained at least 30 feet of distance from BCCP boundary in an urban settings. I see City of Cedar Park violating all rules when they worked on the expansion project. They have left less than 1 feet distance right now between road and BCCP boundary and also messed up many things related to safety and noise prevention and many more compliances laid down by them.
In my understanding there is some relaxation to the distance rule only if the count of vehicles passing is less than 750 or else AASHTO road standards says so. I have reviewed on my end and AASHTO does not reduce the distance to mere 1 feet and the vehicle count is way way more than 750 every day. This road is now a highway and with no safety.
Given the speed at which vehicles pass day and night and the count (Well above 750 per day for sure), and the loud noise the road is producing (at nuisance level if measured) I think very soon they will destroy the habitat.

Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below
Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken
on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the
    Page 1077 of 1607

  concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road. Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

The intent is only to question about your 'professional' conducts and abilities (which I mean must have some sense of general knowledge, beyond what rule books tells you, not meant to disobey rules in any ways ) as you all are representing HOA, CITY and in general AMERICAN QUALITY of life to anyone who visits and resides legally in your town, or city.
I hope you will accept my apology in this regards.
I will re-draft my questions in better English to the City (and Engineering there) to get the right answers.

Christopher:
Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:
----
SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day- job.

Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements.

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
    Page 1085 of 1607

             General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to- 20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
               Page 1091 of 1607

                     -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
 Page 1092 of 1607

                     [Plan1] Wewillacceptthe8Swooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary- limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
 Page 1093 of 1607

                     We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar
situaQons. No Noise
control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk
 Page 1094 of 1607

control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk
                     analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others
pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
 Page 1095 of 1607

                     - The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
 Page 1096 of 1607

                     From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

I am following up on the email below. Since the fence construcQon is about to start someQme next week, I just wanted to check and see if the right-of-entry withdrawal is sQll in effect. The fence contractor will only be out there for about a week and if you want your fence reconstructed, he needs to complete this work while he is out there. We won’t be paying an addiQonal mobilizaQon fee for the contractor to come back out there aSer he finished the other secQons of fence.

Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below
Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the
  Page 1099 of 1607

 concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

I take this learning forward, and will call all in this email and probably in other places by full names, with Dear, Mr. or Ms. or whatever they prefer to call.
All:
I am not a native English speaker, and many times it becomes a challenge when I ask for things in ways that others feel bad about. I will like to take the opportunity here to reply to all (not just representatives of HOA , but also representatives City, and the engineers, contractors, and anyone in this chain) that:
Please consider this email as my heartfelt apology for using below standards language to show my dissatisfaction in the system. I must have never spoken unkind words even if you were not performing your duties correctly. It is just not right and I am sorry for my language.
There was nothing 'personal' (and nor 'is') when it comes to my questioning of your
actions/or non-actions to be correct. The intent is only to question about your 'professional' conducts and abilities (which I mean must have some sense of general knowledge, beyond what rule books tells you, not meant to disobey rules in any ways ) as you all are representing HOA, CITY and in general AMERICAN QUALITY of life to anyone who visits and resides legally in your town, or city.
I hope you will accept my apology in this regards.
I will re-draft my questions in better English to the City (and Engineering there) to get the right answers. This email may not come today my health isn't doing well with the sudden drastic change in weather. Also, with my subsequent emails, I will remove all HOA board members, HOA manager, and other HOA reps. unless someone replies to this email(in person or reply-all) be in loop.

Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:
----
SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand.

The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Jim has clarified that it is not just HOA, but city may also have its own requirements. Here is his original email (sent 1:1) ... I am sorry, it was my misunderstanding.
Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some
bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
   General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:

            With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it woul likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you ca please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fe and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

my nce..

All,
             Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

(I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs in GOOGLE LINK as attachment did not work

I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

                 The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft
concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here.
Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
             Page 1113 of 1607

                    I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
 Page 1114 of 1607

                    [ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
 Page 1115 of 1607

                    We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There
are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18
wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
 Page 1116 of 1607

                    Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
 Page 1117 of 1607

                    They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )- -
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below
Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Page 1121 of 1607

Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

I will like to take the opportunity here to reply to all (not just representatives of HOA , but also representatives City, and the engineers, contractors, and anyone in this chain) that:
Please consider this email as my heartfelt apology for using below standards language to show my dissatisfaction in the system. I must have never spoken unkind words even if you were not performing your duties correctly. It is just not right and I am sorry for my language.
There was nothing 'personal' (and nor 'is') when it comes to my questioning of your
actions/or non-actions to be correct. The intent is only to question about your 'professional' conducts and abilities (which I mean must have some sense of general knowledge, beyond what rule books tells you, not meant to disobey rules in any ways ) as you all are representing HOA, CITY and in general AMERICAN QUALITY of life to anyone who visits and resides legally in your town, or city.
I hope you will accept my apology in this regards.
I will re-draft my questions in better English to the City (and Engineering there) to get the right answers. This email may not come today my health isn't doing well with the sudden drastic change in weather. Also, with my subsequent emails, I will remove all HOA board members, HOA manager, and other HOA reps. unless someone replies to this email(in person or reply-all) be in loop.
Thanks, Sandeep

1) The homeowners association is not part of the city. The request below is outside the HOA jurisdiction.
2) If you are interested in a meeting with the board, you must request and schedule it with the property manager.

Can you please represent the owner of property to follow-up "in-writing" with City about the 3 major concerns.
You must specifically ask about in-writing response to collect their standing, when were the last tests done, what are the calculations and data of safety, noise, and env. protection.

There was a email from Christopher who is now representing City of Cedar Park TX. I am pasting his email and my reply
Christopher:
Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:
----
SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and below 75db at night (7 pm to 7 am) with exceptions including "motor vehicle motor" (but not tires or any other parts of the vehicle).
reference: https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=7111
I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are
expert in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know. I was in this field of engineering few years back and may give you all some references.

I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear - - if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out.

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements.

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the
conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th- 2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around
  Page 1129 of 1607

           with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.

You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cann please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET m family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fen and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road
of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ...

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the
ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
           Page 1135 of 1607

                   We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
 Page 1136 of 1607

                   Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.

Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or

walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or
                   slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe
journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek
elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in,
but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20
vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
 Page 1138 of 1607

                   - The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept
different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
 Page 1139 of 1607

                   Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Hi All:
I thought that I have replied to all (Including City officials) when I emailed this below on Nov-15th. This carries message for all of you too, so I am re-sending it to everyone except the HOA people as they have told me that this issue does not lie in their jurisdiction.
Email from SaraMarie Blunt, and my response is pasted below. +Sandeep Kalra

SaraMarie Blunt:
Fri, Nov 15, 10:29 AM (8 days ago)
 I really am sorry for calling you 'Sara'. I always remains a bit confused when it comes to name (for e.g. Sam, but name is Samuel, etc). My intention was not to hurt you. I take this learning forward, and will call all in this email and probably in other places by full names, with Dear, Mr. or Ms. or whatever they prefer to call.
All:
I am not a native English speaker, and many times it becomes a challenge when I ask for things in ways that others feel bad about. I will like to take the opportunity here to reply to all (not just representatives of HOA , but also representatives City, and the engineers, contractors, and anyone in this chain) that:
Please consider this email as my heartfelt apology for using below standards language to show my dissatisfaction in the system. I must have never spoken unkind words even if you were not performing your duties correctly. It is just not right and I am sorry for my language.
There was nothing 'personal' (and nor 'is') when it comes to my questioning of your actions/or non-actions to be correct. The intent is only to question about your 'professional'
  Page 1143 of 1607

 conducts and abilities (which I mean must have some sense of general knowledge, beyond what rule books tells you, not meant to disobey rules in any ways ) as you all are representing HOA, CITY and in general AMERICAN QUALITY of life to anyone who visits and resides legally in your town, or city.
I hope you will accept my apology in this regards.
I will re-draft my questions in better English to the City (and Engineering there) to get the right answers. This email may not come today my health isn't doing well with the sudden drastic change in weather. Also, with my subsequent emails, I will remove all HOA board members, HOA manager, and other HOA reps. unless someone replies to this email(in person or reply-all) be in loop.

What is the stand of city for these things:

SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have

  comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and below 75db at night (7 pm to 7 am) with exceptions including "motor vehicle motor" (but not tires or any other parts of the vehicle).
reference: https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=7111
I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are expert
in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know. I was in this field of engineering few years back and may give you all some references.

b) The residents were all were at your monthly HOA meeting inn May-2017 raising the concerns. HOA was there on the day (May-22,2017) when the city called for meeting. I read the whole concerns.pdf document that I also emailed to city. For period of May-2017 and Oct-2019:
Where are the proofs that HOA worked for safety , security, health and welfare of residents if you or anyone in HOA worked and fought for my rights then I will feel confident that you all will represent the owners correctly. When and with Whom did you (or anyone in HOA) interacted with in city to raise concern of the residents? Where is the email chain, or mail, or any record to prove.

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may- 26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements.

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively
respond and let me know that city allso has some
bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
    Page 1149 of 1607

          General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.

You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would m likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road
of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs in GOOGLE LINK as attachment did not work - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day,
and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

To whom so ever it is concern -
Let me know if you have any objections to this request and / or need more information from me. In case you are not the right person, please redirect this to him/her for the immediate action.
The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
       Page 1153 of 1607

               So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want
to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely
decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our
family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the
ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
           Page 1155 of 1607

                  We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non- revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
 Page 1156 of 1607

                  [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In
this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
 Page 1157 of 1607

                  Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in,
but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
 Page 1158 of 1607

                  - Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept
different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--

                   Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before

  waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative
               Page 1167 of 1607

        action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Jim has clarified that it is not just HOA, but city may also have its own requirements. Here is his original email (sent 1:1) ... I am sorry, it was my misunderstanding.
Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

     Page 1168 of 1607

          bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively
respond and let me know that city allso has some
bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would m likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

          Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road
of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching

           to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want
to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely
decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our
family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the
ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
           Page 1175 of 1607

                  We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non- revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In
this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
 Page 1176 of 1607

                  Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18
 Page 1177 of 1607

                  wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in,
but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
 Page 1178 of 1607

                  - The city and HOA would not accept
different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
 Page 1179 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:10:28 Central Standard Time
                   Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

City's own SAFETY Standards, City's own NOISE standards and City's own ENV. PROTECTION standards. The sections of the standards are marked in my email. The city poses to the world that they comply to their own standard for the residents.

Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:
----
SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are expert in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know.

Thank you for your email. SecQon 14.07.007 of the Cedar Park Code of Ordinances (CPCO) regulates fences. I have provided the secQon of the CPCO below for your review. A permit is not required to replace your privacy fence located on your property, but the maximum height is limited to 8 feet. While the City does not enforce deed restricQons or Covenants, CondiQons, and RestricQons (CC&Rs), I recommend you confirm the 8’ masonry wall comply with any HOA requirements that exist. Please let me know if you have any quesQons related to the fencing regulaQons below.
Sec. 14.07.007 Fencing regulations
(a) General regulations.
(1) Fences shall not impede drainage.
(2) No fence or other structure more than thirty (30) percent solid or more than
three (3) feet height shall be located so that it impairs the sight distance triangle at the intersection of any rights-of-way.

a) Why this email now? This email from HOA is 2.5 yrs late.
I have lost confidence in HOA. To gain my confidence, please reply to question-b of this email
b) The residents were all were at your monthly HOA meeting inn May-2017 raising the concerns. HOA was there on the day (May-22,2017) when the city called for meeting. I read the whole concerns.pdf document that I also emailed to city. For period of May-2017 and Oct-2019:
Where are the proofs that HOA worked for safety , security, health and welfare of residents if you or anyone in HOA worked and fought for my rights then I will feel confident that you all will represent the owners correctly. When and with Whom did you (or anyone in HOA) interacted with in city to raise concern of the residents? Where is the email chain, or mail, or any record to prove.
c) the concern document is shared with many in HOA and City. Nothing has changed from my side.
They were delivered in written format, and I can clarify if the English isn't clear (I am not a native English speaker)

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may- 26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to
     Page 1186 of 1607

         abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,

You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot).
New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a
masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
               Page 1192 of 1607

                 -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely
decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our
family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
 Page 1193 of 1607

                 [ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non- revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
 Page 1194 of 1607

                 -- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar
Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this
road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
 Page 1195 of 1607

                 - Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
 Page 1196 of 1607

                 Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Christopher:
Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:
----
SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and below 75db at night (7 pm to 7 am) with exceptions including "motor vehicle motor" (but not tires or any other parts of the vehicle).
reference: https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=7111
I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are expert in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know. I was in this field of engineering few years back and may give you all some references.

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may- 26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements.

My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any
      Page 1204 of 1607

         decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot).
New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

              The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a
masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here.

We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
               Page 1210 of 1607

                 We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely
decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our
family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
 Page 1211 of 1607

                 [ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non- revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.

                 -- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar
Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this
road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.

                 - Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
 Page 1214 of 1607

                 Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Since the fence construcQon is about to start someQme next week, I just wanted to check and see if the right-of-entry withdrawal is sQll in effect. The fence contractor will only be out there for about a week and if you want your fence reconstructed, he needs to complete this work while he is out there. We won’t be paying an addiQonal mobilizaQon fee for the contractor to come back out there aSer he finished the other secQons of fence.

There was a email from Christopher who is now representing City of Cedar Park TX. I am pasting his email and my reply Christopher:
Regulations are just tools for paper pushers to control the life of the others. I am living in hell. The noise-level, pollution from bad air, and ill-designed unsafe intersection is killing me like hell.
What is the stand of city for these things:
----
SAFETY: It is well known that city engineers did not follow TBPE principles to perform the calculations of safety on the structure that they have produced. They even did not have comparable data set to remove the doubt of ill fate of the pedestrians and residents. Last year a girl (aged 17) died in round-rock because the city was not prepared for the traffic, and the road accident took her life. Now they are considering lowering the speed of road to 35mph and putting speed reducers to tackle the creation. How many lives does city of cedar park want before waking up? I will be interested in knowing WHO and WHAT the city of CP has done from the day I highlighted to them of this wrong doings? What. actions did city take against their engineers who were involved.
Uptill now I was not going to TBPE because there is should be a second chance, but I will go to them too.
In the meantime, I will like the city to get a study of safety done by TBPE appointed professionals(not insiders or consultants that city already works with) to give a certificate of conformance.

ARTICLE 8.08 NOISE REGULATIONS of city ordinance talks of noise levels lower than 85db in day time, and below 75db at night (7 pm to 7 am) with exceptions including "motor vehicle motor" (but not tires or any other parts of the vehicle).
reference: https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=7111
I want city to conduct the noise level checks inside my property line with "beam forming microphones" to find the noise levels and come back with the values to show where things stand. If you find problem finding personals and company that are expert in providing equipments to do beam forming sound study do let me know. I was in this field of engineering few years back and may give you all some references.

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I
was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.

        General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how
bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot).
New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals). - You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
           Page 1228 of 1607

                We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
 Page 1229 of 1607

                [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
 Page 1230 of 1607

                Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18
wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others
pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
 Page 1231 of 1607

                - The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:11:02 Central Standard Time
                 Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Sandeep,
The elected president is the member the board tasked with corresponding with homeowners as a means of keeping the communicaQon streamlined. As volunteers, everyone’s Qme is limited and we must maximize the use of Qme in fulfilling our obligaQons.
Not all the members currently serving on the board were in those roles when this ma]er began, nor is our property manager the same. We need to catch everyone up to speed so we can come to a consensus as a group. That said, this is not an issue well suited for email. Our next meeQng is 12/10 and we can offer you an execuQve meeQng at that Qme. Please confirm your willingness to meet.

All: I am a bit sick, and still cannot reply as promptly as I was doing in past. I am pasting the email that I got( with only selective people in CC) from president of HOA, with my reply to it:
Sara:
a) Why this email now? This email from HOA is 2.5 yrs late.
I have lost confidence in HOA. To gain my confidence, please reply to question-b of this email
b) The residents were all were at your monthly HOA meeting inn May-2017 raising the concerns. HOA was there on the day (May-22,2017) when the city called for meeting. I read the whole concerns.pdf document that I also emailed to city. For period of May-2017 and Oct-2019:
Where are the proofs that HOA worked for safety , security, health and welfare of residents if you or anyone in HOA worked and fought for my rights then I will feel confident that you all will represent the owners correctly. When and with Whom did you (or anyone in HOA) interacted with in city to raise concern of the residents? Where is the email chain, or mail, or any record to prove.
c) the concern document is shared with many in HOA and City. Nothing has changed from my side.
They were delivered in written format, and I can clarify if the English isn't clear (I am not a native English speaker)

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No
           Page 1238 of 1607

     affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the
concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

       Jim,
My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

       Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW

And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in- charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.

I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.

We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
               Page 1245 of 1607

               -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
 Page 1246 of 1607

               [ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
 Page 1247 of 1607

               -- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise
control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
 Page 1248 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:11:13 Central Standard Time
                - The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are
running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the
valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Mr. Kalra,
Thank you for your email. SecQon 14.07.007 of the Cedar Park Code of Ordinances (CPCO) regulates fences. I have provided the secQon of the CPCO below for your review. A permit is not required to replace your privacy fence located on your property, but the maximum height is limited to 8 feet. While the City does not enforce deed restricQons or Covenants, CondiQons, and RestricQons (CC&Rs), I recommend you confirm the 8’ masonry wall comply with any HOA requirements that exist. Please let me know if you have any quesQons related to the fencing regulaQons below.
Sec. 14.07.007 Fencing regulations
(a) General regulations.
(1) Fences shall not impede drainage.
(2) No fence or other structure more than thirty (30) percent solid or more than three (3) feet height shall be located so that it impairs the sight distance triangle at the intersection of any rights- of-way.
(3) Fences and walls must be maintained in a safe manner, plumb (vertical) to the ground. Fences or walls no longer maintained in a safe manner through neglect, lack of repair, manner of construction, method of placement, or otherwise must be repaired, replaced, or demolished. Failure to maintain a fence or wall in accordance with this section constitutes a violation of this section, punishable pursuant to section 1.01.009.
  (4)
Prohibited fence types:
(A) Fences or walls constructed primarily of barbed or razor wire, except for the purpose of enclosing livestock for agricultural purposes in RA districts or properties that have an agriculture exemption;
(B) Fences or walls carrying electrical current, except for the purpose of enclosing livestock for agricultural purposes in RA districts or properties that have an agriculture exemption;
(C) Fences or walls constructed of paper, cloth, canvas, or similar highly flammable material; and
(D) Fences or walls topped with barbed wire or razor wire, except as used by developments within industrial zoning districts, public institutions, or utilities for public safety or security purposes.
(5)
edge of the post.
(6) All residential fences perpendicular to an existing subdivision wall shall meet the subdivision wall at the same height as the existing wall and may transition to a maximum of eight (8) feet in height.
Fence height is measured from the natural grade where the fence post is set to the highest
Page 1252 of 1607

(b) Residential fences.
(1) Fences located in the rear and side setback shall not exceed eight (8) feet in height and shall be constructed of wood, wrought iron, masonry or similar material, permanently affixed to the ground.
(2) Only fences less than or equal to three (3) feet in height shall be allowed in the front setback, except a fence may be allowed in the front setback that is less than or equal to six (6) feet in height if the residential lot is greater than 20,000 square feet. All fences in the front setback taller than three (3) feet shall be constructed of wrought iron or similar material.
(3) For residential subdivisions located on or adjacent to a corridor overlay roadway, see also section 12.12.017 subdivision walls for additional fencing requirements.
(4) Fences required to enclose rear yards of two-family/duplexes residences shall be a minimum of four (4) feet and a maximum eight (8) feet in height and shall provide separate enclosures with gates for each unit.
(5) Fences to be located along a public right-of-way shall face the finished edge toward the public right-of-way.
(6) To create one consistent, horizontal and even plane, all fences shall be installed at the same height as fencing along adjacent common property lines, unless, to do so would require the installed fencing not to comply with the height restrictions set forth in this section 14.07.007(b).

-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restrictions to enter our property still exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collectively decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the rationale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situation at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepting the deal of just a higher (additional 2 ft) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a writing a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of buttercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next action will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
              We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our

   frustration, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execution of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 options/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ft wooden fence if the City does the complete calculation for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in writing that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).

[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ft wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ft at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything better to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculations and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 additional PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ft wooden fence only after making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15ft) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendations when we met the city for the first time in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is attached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspection.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- Rationale --
Property sits at a point where a potential 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple speculations such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all time etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red- lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No Calculations based on models developed using mathematics, science and past experiences from similar situations. No Noise
control. No trees. No pollution checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to
 Page 1256 of 1607

   find 20 other properties in the similar situation in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I left as an easement for utility lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an additional 2 ft high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others
pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ft wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ft away from the road with no protection. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 ft. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons Rationales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ft barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ft high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hitting the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeting with details) that they will give at least 3 ft barrier and retention wall to all properties, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will question them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences until they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA. - Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact sections per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculations.

-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ft margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 ft. Max distance is 9 ft from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeting point: Min is 9 ft, and the Max distance is at 10 ft from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 ft. Farthest is 20+ ft.

We won’t be paying an additional mobilization fee for the contractor to come back out there after he finished the other sections of fence.
Thanks, Alan

Can you please reply all to let all know what they mean? Shall my money to HOA makes them liable to provide me with these basic benefits?
Also, it will be great if you can show the meeting-dispositions and conclusions from May-2017 when all residents showed up and mentioned of these concerns, any other meeting-disposition and conclusions with City of Cedar Park where you all have taken these agendas, or any internal meeting-disposition where you have decided anything affirmatively to tackle these concerns.

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements.

My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.

General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
      With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

All,
Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot).
              Page 1264 of 1607

       New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in- charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs in GOOGLE LINK as attachment did not work - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and
let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10

           ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov- 15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on
this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a
higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
           Page 1268 of 1607

              We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
 Page 1269 of 1607

              We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon
checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek
elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
 Page 1270 of 1607

              My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property
line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are
running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
 Page 1271 of 1607

              They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the
valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

BESIDE JIM (HOA Rep), I am also marking PRESIDENT, VICE-PRESIDENT, SECRETARY, and COMMUNITY DIRECTOR of HOA for getting the answers:
Q-1: Attached with this email is zip of the website (www.westsidehoa.org.zip, all files were backed up using linux tool 'wget and curl' ). I will keenly wait for the roles and responsibilities of HOA in regards to HEALTH, SAFETY, WELFARE OF OWNERS and other terms as mentioned in CC&R and Bylaws. For me, these are owner's rights... and want to know if you think otherwise.
Q-2: Do you keep any records of meetings, emails, and communication. I need the records of last 3 years (Starting Jan-01-2017 till Today).

This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my
property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
    Page 1277 of 1607

     Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Subject: Re: Notice of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov- 15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding:
               Page 1279 of 1607

      - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION - NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.

To whom so ever it is concern -
Let me know if you have any objections to this request and / or need more information from me. In case you are not the right person, please redirect this to him/her for the immediate action.
The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov- 15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a
higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
           Page 1283 of 1607

             -- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City
and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
 Page 1284 of 1607

             We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow
down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18
wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon
checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
 Page 1285 of 1607

             Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20
vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
 Page 1286 of 1607

             Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what

  paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out.
I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

    Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my
property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov- 15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

         The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th- 2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
           Page 1297 of 1607

            We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City
and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In
this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
 Page 1298 of 1607

            Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow
down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18
wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is
the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
 Page 1299 of 1607

            My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20
vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.

             -- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40- 50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).

When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

(I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs in GOOGLE LINK as attachment did not work - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
      Page 1309 of 1607

        So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft
concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th- 2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
           Page 1311 of 1607

           We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary- limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In
this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
 Page 1312 of 1607

           We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There
are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon
checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
 Page 1313 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:11:55 Central Standard Time
            - By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20
vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
 Page 1314 of 1607

           From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Jim:
This is specifically to you
You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.
The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security. Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?
I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.
What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements.

Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.

I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the
Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
           Page 1324 of 1607

          [ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary- limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
 Page 1325 of 1607

          We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There
are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar
situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek
elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
 Page 1326 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:12:03 Central Standard Time
           - The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S. Thanks,

@all:
Jim has clarified that it is not just HOA, but city may also have its own requirements. Here is his original email (sent 1:1) ... I am sorry, it was my misunderstanding.
Sandeep,
Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence. I did not say the City has no role
in this. The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build. That is something you will need to find out. the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

  My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Page 1330 of 1607

 Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
            Page 1332 of 1607

 I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot). New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
           Page 1336 of 1607

         We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
 Page 1337 of 1607

         We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar
situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
 Page 1338 of 1607

         - By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.

Jim,
My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.
Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.
 General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
Page 1342 of 1607

 With my future responses you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.
Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.
Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

to me
Hi Sandeep,
Wed, Nov 6, 9:26 AM (15 hours ago)
You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied. I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines. If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

All,
Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot).
             Page 1344 of 1607

 New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably
all pedestrians do too).

    when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs in GOOGLE LINK as attachment did not work - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same

Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

To whom so ever it is concern -
Let me know if you have any objections to this request and / or need more information from me. In case you are not the right person, please redirect this to him/her for the immediate action.
The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...

     No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?
I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot).
New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].
What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).
I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).
When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding: - SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
- You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably
all pedestrians do too).

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient. -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
 [ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA
 Page 1358 of 1607

        undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street
 Page 1359 of 1607

        lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise
control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the
 Page 1360 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:12:25 Central Standard Time
         engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient. -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
           Page 1367 of 1607

       -- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
 Page 1368 of 1607

       We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in,
but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply
 Page 1369 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:12:31 Central Standard Time
        walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs in GOOGLE LINK as attachment did not work - just to show pollution)

  I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

To whom so ever it is concern -
Let me know if you have any objections to this request and / or need more information from me. In case you are not the right person, please redirect this to him/her for the immediate action.
The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a
masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs in GOOGLE LINK as attachment did not work - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft
concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th- 2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restrictions to enter our property still exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collectively decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the rationale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situation at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepting the deal of just a higher (additional 2 ft) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a writing a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of buttercup creek, Cedar Park, TX)
and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next action will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustration, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execution of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 options/plans given below.
             Page 1384 of 1607

    [ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 ft wooden fence if the City does the complete calculation for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in writing that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ft wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in writing a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ft wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ft at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything better to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculations and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 additional PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 ft wooden fence only after making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15ft) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendations when we met the city for the first time in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is attached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspection.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- Rationale --
Property sits at a point where a potential 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple speculations such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all time etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No Calculations based on models developed using mathematics, science and past experiences from similar
situations. No Noise control. No trees. No pollution checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properties in the similar situation in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I left as an easement for utility lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an additional 2 ft high wood

     fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ft wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ft away from the road with no protection. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 ft. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons Rationales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ft barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ft high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hitting the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeting with details) that they will give at least 3 ft barrier and retention wall to all properties, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will question them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences until they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact sections per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculations.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepting whatever the engineers
suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade Austin-City to give part of the land that Austin uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ft margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 ft. Max distance is 9 ft from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeting point: Min is 9 ft, and the Max distance is at 10 ft from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 ft. Farthest is 20+ ft.

I am following up on the email below. Since the fence construction is about to start sometime next week, I just wanted to check and see if the right-of- entry withdrawal is still in effect. The fence contractor will only be out there for about a week and if you want your fence reconstructed, he needs to complete this work while he is out there. We won’t be paying an additional mobilization fee for the contractor to come back out there after he finished the other sections of fence.

Subject: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
As a property owner of '201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park TX, USA 78613' I am sending this email as an official no^ce of withdrawal of all permissions given by orally or in wri^ng to the city of Cedar Park to Enter my property line and/or to modify the current fence or anything else ^ll I feel that the city has ensured the safety and security of the resident and neighborhood while developing and expanding Anderson mill road project.
This is effec^ve right now i.e. Aug-01-2018 ^me 11:45 PM.
Note: The property is under video surveillance and if there is any act of entrance recorded by anyone from City, I will take it as a known act of violaQon.

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs in GOOGLE LINK as attachment did not work - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th- 2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoQce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
             Page 1400 of 1607

    [ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole

     Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
 Page 1402 of 1607

    Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

I am following up on the email below. Since the fence construcQon is about to start someQme next week, I just wanted to check and see if the right-of-entry withdrawal is sQll in effect. The fence contractor will only be out there for about a week and if you want your fence reconstructed, he needs to complete this work while he is out there. We won’t be paying an addiQonal mobilizaQon fee for the contractor to come back out there aSer he finished the other secQons of fence.

- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.

    From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.

 Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was
ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient. -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
  [ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA
 Page 1416 of 1607

    undertakes in wriQng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed

     using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.

    -- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--

- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the
 Page 1425 of 1607

   curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Dear Alan,
Lately, the noise level in my house and others near the crossing (Gaspar and Anderson Mill) has increased a lot.
I have been working for some Qme with our neighbors to come to consent for the concrete fence where we all pay the difference for our fences. There is no consensus among all 11 property owners.
             Page 1429 of 1607

 However, we had some success in agreeing for 5 Homes namely 201 Gaspar and 4 adjoining houses of Erica Kaitlin (2421 thru 2415) together. All of us are keen on doing it (primarily because of noise levels we are hearing) plus we are all conQnuous stretch.
At this point, we would like to request to the city through you to provide us with the opQon of concrete fence.
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

Celeste,
I understand that the problem is mainly between the city and the property owner, but HOA keeps its say in between by controlling the requirements of what kind of fence can be laid down and not, and how it must look uniform. As of now, that is already not possible and in future also it won't be possible after I start with my wall. I anticipate that HOA can be another hurdle. So I have taken this email as an opportunity to offer HOA to backup with their underwriting that they will own the problems as well if they try to block.
I will challenge all proceedings against this move in the court if that happens.

We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
               Page 1435 of 1607

   I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuQon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opQons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non- revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in
 Page 1436 of 1607

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:13:14 Central Standard Time
    our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaQonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise
control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.

[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaQon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriQng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriQng a non- revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaQons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiQonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaQons when we met the city for the first Qme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecQon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.

     Property sits at a point where a potenQal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaQons based on models developed using mathemaQcs, science and past experiences from similar situaQons. No Noise
control. No trees. No polluQon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properQes in the similar situaQon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uQlity
lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 g high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecQon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaQonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeQng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenQon wall to all properQes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesQon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unQl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secQons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaQons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepQng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusQn-City to give part of the land that AusQn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.

Celeste,
I understand that the problem is mainly between the city and the property owner, but HOA keeps its say in between by controlling the requirements of what kind of fence can be laid down and not, and how it must look uniform. As of now, that is already not possible and in future also it won't be possible after I start with my wall. I anticipate that HOA can be another hurdle. So I have taken this email as an opportunity to offer HOA to backup with their underwriting that they will own the problems as well if they try to block.
I will challenge all proceedings against this move in the court if that happens.

We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecQvely decided that the Anderson mill road
expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaQon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepQng the deal of just a
higher (addiQonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriQng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acQon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraQon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the
             Page 1451 of 1607

   execuQon of this project.

- On the right-turn lane, make speed-reducers at every 40 S, so that the traffic is almost at 20 mph on the turn.
- Give me a concrete wall/fence for the safety of my family.
- Give 3 S protecQve metal barrier on the roadside. They are not concrete structure and do not block line of sight.
- Take ownership of 10 S land between property line and road, and plant electric poles 40 S apart (for lights) so that the metal fence and the sidewalk is clearly visible at all Qmes.
- Make travel thru these 11 properQes a double-fine zone.
- Install traffic camera and fine on double on speed violaQon (specially between 7 - 9 am and 3-5 pm when kids use this road)

Are you available for coming down to the property and show us the 11 S distance that you talked about? Also, Please send a copy of the drawings (or bring it for us to scan it) of the road that shows the claimed distance from my property line.
My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 S from the property line.
Please give me the window when you can be available.

There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.

   I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).
Thanks.

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Wanda,
Thank you for chatting with me today. It was great to catch up with you, yet I'm sorry the surrounding circumstances I brought you are so dire. As we talked about, I'm simply in need of an attorney who can provide me with solid legal counsel and inform me of my legal avenues.
To recap, a few affected neighbors and I are looking into the legalities of the Anderson Mill expansion project's impact on our properties; specifically, this relates to the road proximity - and subsequent sound levels - resulting from widening the thoroughfare to within mere feet of our fence line.
Here are the published details about the project through Williamson County. Here are the details (under project ID T5) from the City of Cedar Park.
Plat Map Recording Sheet - we are Lot 7 on page 3
Cedar Park Code of Ordinances - this can easily be searched & navigated by using keyword terms. I searched around "setbacks" and was directed to a grid of measurements, but I can't make much sense of the abbreviations used. I searched for a legend and could not find one.
I've attached some images of our fence line, as well. As you can see, the road is already too close for comfort; you'll also see the stakes in the ground that delineate the point to where the road will ultimately
      Page 1470 of 1607

 end.
Sam Roberts, the Assistant City Manager, replied today to a set of inquiries I posed to him, so I have attached that e-mail for you here. This isn't the first round of correspondence that he & I have shared; however, what I've included here accurately represents my deep reservations about the sound, in addition to his indication of a permanent safety barrier. While I'm grateful I was able to accomplish the latter, we must figure out a way to get a noise barrier. As part of this effort, I have a professional acoustics consultant coming out to my house on Friday to take decibel level readings. My expectation (and hope) is that the db levels are in violation of those set forth in the city ordinance.
Wanda, thank you so much for your help! Let me know if you need anything more from me. Brian

Darwin,
I appreciate you confirming that there are no calculaQons done. I am not a judge on the meaning of words. I have just expressed what it means to me and you have expressed your thoughts. You do not take my interpretaQon, and nor will I not take yours or LeAnn's. T.B.P.E. published it and owns it and they are there to clarify. We as engineers must abide to it. They will let us know.
The fact of ma]er is that this property unlike any other property in Cedar Park, this property is siÄng at less than 10 S from road with no protecQon where there is a WB-19[WB-62] trucks are allowed(northbound) to pass and they can speed anywhere between 45MPH to 40 MPH. They are not restricted from turning right either, and even if the restricQons are put in place there are 0 checks to handle it. With a turn lane, the possibiliQes of the overtaking cannot be overruled. A simple Curb cannot deflect traffic.
This pathway is used by not just me, or my family but by school kids, joggers and bicyclists too. I am not a "assumpQon" guy as you are but just for the sake of argument if I put some schenarios here
(a) assume that just one of the driver is Qred, and driSs at 3:00 PM when school kids are walking back, then you all will be responsible. A wooden fence isn't good for me/my family to even sit in my own backyard at any Qme. (b) My son plays frisbie with me. What if that flies out and someone goes to pick it while a mishap is siÄng there to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.
How can the engineers overlook it even aSer this was menQoned in first meeQng. I have audio-recording from Brian where we told the city in first meeQng that students travel that path, drunk drivers have crashed in(southbound), and there is a need for safety study to be done if it hasn't been done. Was that asking for our concern a joke or just a check-list so that we are informed?
           Page 1478 of 1607

  One day I might sell this property and move out but unQl that happens and if I live there in that place and face this 24x7x365. I will always feel unsafe if this situaQon isn't resolved. You give me just 20 such properQes in whole Cedar Park where you all have done something similar and big trucks comes at 45mph and you have not seen any problem.I have posted about this in wriQng to engineering team in first meeQng. I even read it loud in meeQng on that day. I am a]aching it right now (concerns.pdf) again for everyone reference.
These drawings are flawed and this is a case of gross negligence on part of everyone who has worked on the project and overlooked these aspects. This isn't engineering at all.
When the drawings were made (shows less than 6 S distance between curb and fence) then someone must have either overridden the safety clause of it is in part responsibility even goes to the draSer and engineer for laying out this plan.
I invite anyone and everyone here to put his/her opinion, facts. Sandeep

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
        Page 1479 of 1607

  I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us
           Page 1483 of 1607

     for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.

            I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

In the United States, there are approximately 2 million big rig trucks. Nationally, about 500,000 accidents involving 18-wheeler trucks occur yearly. Of those accidents, an estimated 5,000 result in death. Of these fatalities, 98 percent are the death of the driver or a passenger of the vehicle other than the 18-wheeler involved.
Large, heavy truck accidents cause approximately 130,000 injuries every year in the U.S.
The time of day you are driving can also make you safer on the road. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, most truck crashes occurred between noon and 3:00 p.m. in 2014. With a total of 17 percent of all truck crashes throughout the day and night happening between these hours, it resulted in the deaths of 622 individuals.

10 percent of truck drivers felt under pressure
Seven percent were overly tired

The fact of ma]er is that this property unlike any other property in Cedar Park, this property is siÄng at less than 10 S from road with no protecQon where there is a WB-19[WB-62] trucks are allowed(northbound) to pass and they can speed anywhere between 45MPH to 40 MPH.

This pathway is used by not just me, or my family but by school kids, joggers and bicyclists too. I am not a "assumpQon" guy as you are but just for the sake of argument if I put some schenarios here
(a) assume that just one of the driver is Qred, and driSs at 3:00 PM when school kids are walking back, then you all will be responsible. A wooden fence isn't good for me/my family to even sit in my own backyard at any Qme.
(b) My son plays frisbie with me. What if that flies out and someone goes to pick it while a mishap is siÄng there to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.

to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.
 How can the engineers overlook it even aSer this was menQoned in first meeQng. I have audio-recording from Brian where we told the city in first meeQng that students travel that path, drunk drivers have crashed in(southbound), and there is a need for safety study to be done if it hasn't been done. Was that asking for our concern a joke or just a check-list so that we are informed?
One day I might sell this property and move out but unQl that happens and if I live there in that place and face this 24x7x365. I will always feel unsafe if this situaQon isn't resolved. You give me just 20 such properQes in whole Cedar Park where you all have done something similar and big trucks comes at 45mph and you have not seen any problem.I have posted about this in wriQng to engineering team in first meeQng. I even read it loud in meeQng on that day. I am a]aching it right now (concerns.pdf) again for everyone reference.
These drawings are flawed and this is a case of gross negligence on part of everyone who has worked on the project and overlooked these aspects. This isn't engineering at all.
When the drawings were made (shows less than 6 S distance between curb and fence) then someone must have either overridden the safety clause of it is in part responsibility even goes to the draSer and engineer for laying out this plan.
I invite anyone and everyone here to put his/her opinion, facts. Sandeep

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
        Page 1491 of 1607

 The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

      When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons
        Page 1502 of 1607

can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

David, I read your arQcle in KXAN regarding TX DOT. I think you will look into this invesQgaQon Qp:
I want you all to see this whole thread to understand the depth of it. The city of Cedar Park has not followed the standards laid down by engineering board and is execuQng them without any risk analysis or calculaQons. This is mandatory secQon that any license engineer must have followed as per TBPE rulebook. From the language of their reply it looks like they must have executed many such projects , technically risking lives of many!

Darwin,
I appreciate you confirming that there are no calculaQons done. I am not a judge on the meaning of words. I have just expressed what it means to me and you have expressed your thoughts. You do not take my interpretaQon, and nor will I not take yours or LeAnn's. T.B.P.E. published it and owns it and they are there to clarify. We as engineers must abide to it. They will let us know.
The fact of ma]er is that this property unlike any other property in Cedar Park, this property is siÄng at less than 10 S from road with no protecQon where there is a WB-19[WB-62] trucks are allowed(northbound) to pass and they can speed anywhere between 45MPH to 40 MPH. They are not restricted from turning right either, and even if the restricQons are put in place there are 0 checks to handle it. With a turn lane, the possibiliQes of the overtaking cannot be overruled. A simple Curb cannot deflect traffic.
This pathway is used by not just me, or my family but by school kids, joggers and bicyclists too. I am not a "assumpQon" guy as you are but just for the sake of argument if I put some schenarios here
(a) assume that just one of the driver is Qred, and driSs at 3:00 PM when school kids are walking back, then you all will be responsible. A wooden fence isn't good for me/my family to even sit in my own backyard at any Qme.
(b) My son plays frisbie with me. What if that flies out and someone goes to pick it while a mishap is siÄng there to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.
How can the engineers overlook it even aSer this was menQoned in first meeQng. I have audio-recording from Brian where we told the city in first meeQng that students travel that path, drunk drivers have crashed in(southbound), and there is a need for safety study to be done if it hasn't been done.

I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so

close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
           The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Darwin,
I appreciate you confirming that there are no calculaQons done. I am not a judge on the meaning of words. I have just expressed what it means to me and you have expressed your thoughts. You do not take my interpretaQon, and nor will I not take yours or LeAnn's. T.B.P.E. published it and owns it and they are there to clarify. We as engineers must abide to it. They will let us know.
The fact of ma]er is that this property unlike any other property in Cedar Park, this property is siÄng at less than 10 S from road with no protecQon where there is a WB-19[WB-62] trucks are allowed(northbound) to pass and they can speed anywhere between 45MPH to 40 MPH. They are not restricted from turning right either, and even if the restricQons are put in place there are 0 checks to handle it. With a turn lane, the possibiliQes of the overtaking cannot be overruled. A simple Curb cannot deflect traffic.
This pathway is used by not just me, or my family but by school kids, joggers and bicyclists too. I am not a "assumpQon" guy as you are but just for the sake of argument if I put some schenarios here
(a) assume that just one of the driver is Qred, and driSs at 3:00 PM when school kids are walking back, then you all will be responsible. A wooden fence isn't good for me/my family to even sit in my own backyard at any Qme.
(b) My son plays frisbie with me. What if that flies out and someone goes to pick it while a mishap is siÄng there to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.
How can the engineers overlook it even aSer this was menQoned in first meeQng. I have audio-recording from Brian where we told the city in first meeQng that students travel that path, drunk drivers have crashed in(southbound), and
       Page 1525 of 1607

there is a need for safety study to be done if it hasn't been done. Was that asking for our concern a joke or just a check-list so that we are informed?
One day I might sell this property and move out but unQl that happens and if I live there in that place and face this 24x7x365. I will always feel unsafe if this situaQon isn't resolved. You give me just 20 such properQes in whole Cedar Park where you all have done something similar and big trucks comes at 45mph and you have not seen any problem.I have posted about this in wriQng to engineering team in first meeQng. I even read it loud in meeQng on that day. I am a]aching it right now (concerns.pdf) again for everyone reference.
These drawings are flawed and this is a case of gross negligence on part of everyone who has worked on the project and overlooked these aspects. This isn't engineering at all.
When the drawings were made (shows less than 6 S distance between curb and fence) then someone must have either overridden the safety clause of it is in part responsibility even goes to the draSer and engineer for laying out this plan.
I invite anyone and everyone here to put his/her opinion, facts. Sandeep

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has
        Page 1526 of 1607

adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

I want you all to see this whole thread to understand the depth of it. The city of Cedar Park has not followed the standards laid down by engineering board and is execuQng them without any risk analysis or calculaQons. This is mandatory secQon that any license engineer must have followed as per TBPE rulebook. From the language of their reply it looks like they must have executed many such projects , technically risking lives of many!
Note: Usually I disconnect any caller who is not added to my phonebook. SMS me to setup a call if you want to speak.

Darwin,
I appreciate you confirming that there are no calculaQons done. I am not a judge on the meaning of words. I have just expressed what it means to me and you have expressed your thoughts. You do not take my interpretaQon, and nor will I not take yours or LeAnn's. T.B.P.E. published it and owns it and they are there to clarify. We as engineers must abide to it. They will let us know.
The fact of ma]er is that this property unlike any other property in Cedar Park, this property is siÄng at less than 10 S from road with no protecQon where there is a WB-19[WB-62] trucks are allowed(northbound) to pass and they can speed anywhere between 45MPH to 40 MPH. They are not restricted from turning right either, and even if the restricQons are put in place there are 0 checks to handle it. With a turn lane, the possibiliQes of the overtaking cannot be overruled. A simple Curb cannot deflect traffic.
This pathway is used by not just me, or my family but by school kids, joggers and bicyclists too. I am not a "assumpQon" guy as you are but just for the sake of argument if I put some schenarios here
(a) assume that just one of the driver is Qred, and driSs at 3:00 PM when school kids are walking back, then you all will be responsible. A wooden fence isn't good for me/my family to even sit in my own backyard at any Qme.
(b) My son plays frisbie with me. What if that flies out and someone goes to pick it while a mishap is siÄng there to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.
How can the engineers overlook it even aSer this was menQoned in first meeQng. I have audio-recording from
         Page 1541 of 1607

 Brian where we told the city in first meeQng that students travel that path, drunk drivers have crashed in(southbound), and there is a need for safety study to be done if it hasn't been done. Was that asking for our concern a joke or just a check-list so that we are informed?
One day I might sell this property and move out but unQl that happens and if I live there in that place and face this 24x7x365. I will always feel unsafe if this situaQon isn't resolved. You give me just 20 such properQes in whole Cedar Park where you all have done something similar and big trucks comes at 45mph and you have not seen any problem.I have posted about this in wriQng to engineering team in first meeQng. I even read it loud in meeQng on that day. I am a]aching it right now (concerns.pdf) again for everyone reference.
These drawings are flawed and this is a case of gross negligence on part of everyone who has worked on the project and overlooked these aspects. This isn't engineering at all.
When the drawings were made (shows less than 6 S distance between curb and fence) then someone must have either overridden the safety clause of it is in part responsibility even goes to the draSer and engineer for laying out this plan.
I invite anyone and everyone here to put his/her opinion, facts. Sandeep

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon
        Page 1542 of 1607

 design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is
           Page 1546 of 1607

    a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as
the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).
Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
       Page 1550 of 1607

           I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

   Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

        Hi Darwin,
 There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

         make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
     Page 1561 of 1607

          The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

In the United States, there are approximately 2 million big rig trucks. Nationally, about 500,000 accidents involving 18-wheeler trucks occur yearly. Of those accidents, an estimated 5,000 result in death. Of these fatalities, 98 percent are the death of the driver or a passenger of the vehicle other than the 18-wheeler involved.
Large, heavy truck accidents cause approximately 130,000 injuries every year in the U.S.
The time of day you are driving can also make you safer on the road. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, most truck crashes occurred between noon and 3:00 p.m. in 2014. With a total of 17 percent of all truck crashes throughout the day and night happening between these hours, it resulted in the deaths of 622 individuals.

According to the Large Truck Crash Causation Study conducted for the FMCSA:
Twenty-seven percent of trucks were found to have brake problems Nineteen percent of drivers were unfamiliar with the route
10 percent of truck drivers felt under pressure
Seven percent were overly tired

I appreciate you confirming that there are no calculaQons done. I am not a judge on the meaning of words. I have just expressed what it means to me and you have expressed your thoughts. You do not take my interpretaQon, and nor will I not take yours or LeAnn's. T.B.P.E. published it and owns it and they are there to clarify. We as engineers must abide to it. They will let us know.
The fact of ma]er is that this property unlike any other property in Cedar Park, this property is siÄng at less than 10 S from road with no protecQon where there is a WB-19[WB-62] trucks are allowed(northbound) to pass and they can speed anywhere between 45MPH to 40 MPH. They are not restricted from turning right either, and even if the restricQons are put in place there are 0 checks to handle it. With a turn lane, the possibiliQes of the overtaking cannot be overruled. A simple Curb cannot deflect traffic.
This pathway is used by not just me, or my family but by school kids, joggers and bicyclists too. I am not a "assumpQon" guy as you are but just for the sake of argument if I put some schenarios here
(a) assume that just one of the driver is Qred, and driSs at 3:00 PM when school kids are walking back, then you all will be responsible. A wooden fence isn't good for me/my family to even sit in my own backyard at any Qme.
(b) My son plays frisbie with me. What if that flies out and someone goes to pick it while a mishap is siÄng there to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.
How can the engineers overlook it even aSer this was menQoned in first meeQng. I have audio-recording from Brian where we told the city in first meeQng that students travel that path, drunk drivers have crashed in(southbound), and there is a need for safety study to be done if it hasn't been done. Was that asking for our concern a joke or just a check-list so that we are informed?
One day I might sell this property and move out but unQl that happens and if I live there in that place and face this 24x7x365. I will always feel unsafe if this situaQon isn't resolved. You give me just 20 such properQes in whole Cedar Park where you all have done something similar and big trucks comes at 45mph and you have not seen any problem.I have posted about this in wriQng to engineering team in first meeQng. I even read it loud in meeQng on that day. I am a]aching it right now (concerns.pdf) again for everyone reference.

 These drawings are flawed and this is a case of gross negligence on part of everyone who has worked on the
 project and overlooked these aspects. This isn't engineering at all.
When the drawings were made (shows less than 6 S distance between curb and fence) then someone must have either overridden the safety clause of it is in part responsibility even goes to the draSer and engineer for laying out this plan.
I invite anyone and everyone here to put his/her opinion, facts. Sandeep

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.

There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
     Page 1574 of 1607

           When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Darwin,
I appreciate you confirming that there are no calculaQons done. I am not a judge on the meaning of words. I have just expressed what it means to me and you have expressed your thoughts. You do not take my interpretaQon, and nor will I not take yours or LeAnn's. T.B.P.E. published it and owns it and they are there to clarify. We as engineers must abide to it. They will let us know.
The fact of ma]er is that this property unlike any other property in Cedar Park, this property is siÄng at less than 10 S from road with no protecQon where there is a WB-19[WB-62] trucks are allowed(northbound) to pass and they can speed anywhere between 45MPH to 40 MPH. They are not restricted from turning right either, and even if the restricQons are put in place there are 0 checks to handle it. With a turn lane, the possibiliQes of the overtaking cannot be overruled. A simple Curb cannot deflect traffic.
This pathway is used by not just me, or my family but by school kids, joggers and bicyclists too. I am not a "assumpQon" guy as you are but just for the sake of argument if I put some schenarios here
(a) assume that just one of the driver is Qred, and driSs at 3:00 PM when school kids are walking back, then you all will be responsible. A wooden fence isn't good for me/my family to even sit in my own backyard at any Qme. (b) My son plays frisbie with me. What if that flies out and someone goes to pick it while a mishap is siÄng there to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.
How can the engineers overlook it even aSer this was menQoned in first meeQng. I have audio-recording from Brian where we told the city in first meeQng that students travel that path, drunk drivers have crashed in(southbound), and there is a need for safety study to be done if it hasn't been done. Was that asking for our concern a joke or just a check-list so that we are informed?
One day I might sell this property and move out but unQl that happens and if I live there in that place and face this 24x7x365. I will always feel unsafe if this situaQon isn't resolved. You give me just 20 such properQes in whole Cedar Park where you all have done something similar and big trucks comes at 45mph and you have not seen any problem.I have posted about this in wriQng to engineering team in first meeQng. I even read it loud in meeQng on that day. I am a]aching it right now (concerns.pdf) again for everyone reference.

  These drawings are flawed and this is a case of gross negligence on part of everyone who has worked on the project and overlooked these aspects. This isn't engineering at all.
When the drawings were made (shows less than 6 S distance between curb and fence) then someone must have either overridden the safety clause of it is in part responsibility even goes to the draSer and engineer for laying out this plan.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secQon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaQon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaQon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeQng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on
         Page 1577 of 1607

  the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noQced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacQng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

     Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeQng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaQon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaQzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
          There is a 12 S siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from
 Page 1581 of 1607

     stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaQons and assumpQons and speculaQon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaQons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaQon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaQons or no calculaQons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporQng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menQoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats
to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

   Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menQon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menQoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraQng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaQon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaQons you are looking for. The roadway cross secQons can be found in the City of AusQn’s TransportaQon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secQons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaQon of State Highway TransportaQon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).

         also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close
     Page 1600 of 1607

to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
          The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

ADachments: concerns(1).pdf
Darwin,
I appreciate you confirming that there are no calculaQons done. I am not a judge on the meaning of words. I have just expressed what it means to me and you have expressed your thoughts. You do not take my interpretaQon, and nor will I not take yours or LeAnn's. T.B.P.E. published it and owns it and they are there to clarify. We as engineers must abide to it. They will let us know.
The fact of ma]er is that this property unlike any other property in Cedar Park, this property is siÄng at less than 10 S from road with no protecQon where there is a WB-19[WB-62] trucks are allowed(northbound) to pass and they can speed anywhere between 45MPH to 40 MPH. They are not restricted from turning right either, and even if the restricQons are put in place there are 0 checks to handle it. With a turn lane, the possibiliQes of the overtaking cannot be overruled. A simple Curb cannot deflect traffic.
This pathway is used by not just me, or my family but by school kids, joggers and bicyclists too. I am not a "assumpQon" guy as you are but just for the sake of argument if I put some schenarios here
(a) assume that just one of the driver is Qred, and driSs at 3:00 PM when school kids are walking back, then you all will be responsible. A wooden fence isn't good for me/my family to even sit in my own backyard at any Qme.
(b) My son plays frisbie with me. What if that flies out and someone goes to pick it while a mishap is siÄng there to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.
How can the engineers overlook it even aSer this was menQoned in first meeQng. I have audio-recording from Brian where we told the city in first meeQng that students travel that path, drunk drivers have crashed in(southbound), and there is a need for safety study to be done if it hasn't been done. Was that asking for our concern a joke or just a check-list so that we are informed?
One day I might sell this property and move out but unQl that happens and if I live there in that place and face this 24x7x365. I will always feel unsafe if this situaQon isn't resolved. You give me just 20 such properQes in whole Cedar Park where you all have done something similar and big trucks comes at 45mph and you have not seen any problem.I have posted about this in wriQng to engineering team in first meeQng. I even read it loud in meeQng on that day. I am a]aching it right now (concerns.pdf) again for everyone reference.
These drawings are flawed and this is a case of gross negligence on part of everyone who has worked on the project and overlooked these aspects. This isn't engineering at all.
When the drawings were made (shows less than 6 S distance between curb and fence) then someone must have either overridden the safety clause of it is in part responsibility even goes to the draSer and engineer for laying out this plan.
I invite anyone and everyone here to put his/her opinion, facts.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaQons) and “E” (EsQmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaQons for the project as well as links to where those specificaQons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esQmate although we disagree as to what the term “esQmate” is defined as. The esQmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcQon of the project.
The calculaQons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcQon plans and the only calculaQons that they performed are the drainage calculaQons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusQn TransportaQon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual.

My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 S from the property line.
Please give me the window when you can be available.
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

There are a lot of "assumpQons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have

        every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliQes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaQve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acQon (or not).
Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiQonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraQng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiQonal separaQon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaQon. The City is installing a barrier further

         north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properQes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secQon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaQons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaQon. I hope this informaQon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiQonal quesQons.
Thanks, Darwin

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converQng from exisQng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeQng with the city, and I clearly menQoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluQon etc. In the city meeQng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saQsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
