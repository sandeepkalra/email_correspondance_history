In Nov-2018 a quarry truck caused a damage to my fence. You can visit today=
 to see the crack .. I am not going to repair it with a wooden picket. It i=
s not going to hold another such blow. Email was promptly sent to city engi=
neer about the damage and how his work has not been able to protect my prop=
erty.

The picket fence to handle traffic such as this was a lollypop that city ga=
ve to satisfy the residents when they did the road expansion. It is worthle=
ss even after me pointing that they have *not done any safety checks for an=
y road work*.

Last month a truck make a pile of pebbles in the front road and with the tr=
ucks coming in (even to turn around) my property is not safe to even stand =
outside in the front yard, or to walk on the walkway.

This is unprofessional and willful negligence of safety by the city, and co=

Please do let me know how you will handle it?

City of Cedar Park and HOA:

Here are truckers gossiping while I was about to take my son to school toda=
y morning at 8:00AM. Now it can be argued that they just entered by mistake=
, and to them I have less to say.. but what I have to highlight is that eve=
n if this was a mistake and they will turn around but to my family is still=
 at risk of even standing outside.

Please give us safety. Prove that this is not going to hurt. The road and t=
he intersection is unsafe and if it is not then make it safe.
