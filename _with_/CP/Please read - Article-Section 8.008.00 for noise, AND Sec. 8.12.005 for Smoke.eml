Dear City of Cedar Park:

I have emailed number of times to various authorities within your offices t=
o kindly come and take readings for noise and smoke levels, and till now it=
 has been ignored. Part of it was that city does not think that they have t=
o give sound barrier because as per their engineering team the city isn=92t=
 (a) giving it to noise produced by transport vehicle =96 which is wrong be=
cause except the exception of just the motor of the vehicle all else is mea=
surable and included (b) they do not offer sound-barrier to anyone except m=
aybe highways. Well, Anderson Mill Rd is a major artery now and that was in=
 planning for almost a decade, and there are other arteries such as Bell Bl=
vd that was planned for sound-barrier.

I will reiterate here the same request one last time. The regulations that =
city is not complying to are specifically:

Article/Section 8.008.00 for noise, AND Sec. 8.12.005 for Smoke



Thanks,
Sandeep
PS: You will need contractor that can do noise readings w/ beamforming micr=
ophone.
