Dear CP Council:

This is my fourth (#4th time) time requesting to kindly do noise and smoke =
analysis on my property.

The email thread is attached. It is my understanding that the TXDOT and Cit=
y=92s own compliance ordinances are designed to protect my property from hi=
gh noise and pollution arising due to the expansion of Anderson project (Ph=
ase-1 and now with Phase-2).

Please let me know your official response.

Thanks,
Sandeep

Dear CP Council.

This is my third time requesting you to kindly do noise and smoke readings =
at my property. They were in part done by me and the readings were no compl=
iant to what the city standards are. As far as sound goes, my whole upper l=
evel of property and downstairs 1 room is impacted and will like you please=
 do the noise level testing both at night time and in day. Similarly, the p=
ollution level at the boundary opening to road is high and all the vegetati=
on is lost to it.

In my understanding, the city has to comply to its own standards:
Article/Section 8.008.00 for noise, AND Sec. 8.12.005 for Smoke

If I am not able to make it clear, then please ask .. I am waiting for an o=
fficial response from you.

Thanks,
Sandeep

5 for Smoke
Dear City of Cedar Park:

I have emailed number of times to various authorities within your offices t=
o kindly come and take readings for noise and smoke levels, and till now it=
 has been ignored. Part of it was that city does not think that they have t=
o give sound barrier because as per their engineering team the city isn=92t=
 (a) giving it to noise produced by transport vehicle =96 which is wrong be=
cause except the exception of just the motor of the vehicle all else is mea=
surable and included (b) they do not offer sound-barrier to anyone except m=
aybe highways. Well, Anderson Mill Rd is a major artery now and that was in=
 planning for almost a decade, and there are other arteries such as Bell Bl=
vd that was planned for sound-barrier.

I will reiterate here the same request one last time. The regulations that =
city is not complying to are specifically:

Article/Section 8.008.00 for noise, AND Sec. 8.12.005 for Smoke



Thanks,
Sandeep
PS: You will need contractor that can do noise readings w/ beamforming micr=
ophone.
