Dear Mr. Sam:

I spoke with you, Mr. Alan and Mr. Darwin on 2/14/2020 where you promised m=
e a safety wall, but you-all have never communicated of the wall when I rep=
eatedly asked Mr. Green. I waited and waited for ~3 years to hear back and =
have already given up hopes for that till you said today that you are plann=
ing on a small (looks like your suggesting 2 feet) barrier.. You=92all made=
 me realized that I have trusted someone I mustn=92t ever .. sorry but that=
 is what it is now.

I think a 2-feet barrier that you suggested or just a simple work around wi=
ll not cut the deal with me. If you are going to give barrier because of so=
me pity or compulsion to help then please do not do it. It is not a favor I=
 have asked for. I have asked for safety and safety only, barrier is just a=
 means for it. Had you all followed ASHTO and done safety calculations, the=
n you all would have never faced these situations like one from me.

You all had a chance to fix when you were giving fence, but you all chose w=
ood picket fence. The picket fence got damaged within months after you inst=
alled and I did email Mr. Alan Green of this. I do not know why you and oth=
ers talk of budget cuts on something that can be life saver. What if someon=
e lose their life and you then realize that it could be better? I have been=
 suffering because of this since 2017. Its 5 yrs. now. I have 0 hope and 0 =
trust in anyone in CP.

I was a bit surprised that you mentioned those as protection for the proper=
ty today.. and I want to specifically tell that city must *not assume of th=
ose rocks as safety forever. Those are not city=92s property. They are mine=
*. I will probably move from here in ~2 yrs. (after my son moves to college=
 next Aug).. and I have already decided to take those rocks (if I can) to p=
rotects my family wherever I will. Please do not count of them for somethin=
g that is city=92s responsibilities.

I will move from here with rocks, but will make sure that I have in writing=
 either directly from court or from a capable engineer that this property h=
as been tested and all safety is present to safeguard anyone living, standi=
ng, or passing though gaspar-bnd and Anderson mill road.

Thanks,
Sandeep
PS: I may have drafter this email with saying =93you-all, you etc=94.. but =
I do not mean you as-person, but I mean =93you as professional and/or emplo=
yee of city=94. I do not know anyone personally and that should be fine for=
 asking anyone to do the correct thing.
