City of Cedar Park and HOA:

Here are truckers gossiping while I was about to take my son to school toda=
y morning at 8:00AM. Now it can be argued that they just entered by mistake=
, and to them I have less to say.. but what I have to highlight is that eve=
n if this was a mistake and they will turn around but to my family is still=
 at risk of even standing outside.

Please give us safety. Prove that this is not going to hurt. The road and t=
he intersection is unsafe and if it is not then make it safe.
