   Dear Katie,
Thank you for your response.
Dear Paige:
I am emailing this under FOIA and will like to share the information and get answers. The request is for parcel
CAD Property ID: 181963
Situs Address: LIME CREEK RD 78641 TCAD Acre: 76.03
GIS Acre: 75.77
Geo ID: 0183370101
More Information [propaccess.traviscad.org]
The reason for writing this email was to bring to your knowledge that I have been tracking the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd (that the city of Cedar Park) did was next to BCCP land. They did *NOT* took any permissions with BCCP to construct the road. The road is now 0 cm away from the BCCP. The expansion has also impacted my property too. I have used the BCCP tools that you have given to highlight my property. The road that runs between my property and BCCP Land had ~25 ft distance on both sides, but now it is 0 with BCCP and that too without US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b). They also pushed the road next to my property and now it sits with just a 10 ft walkway in between.
When I inquired to City, the engineers told me(verbally) that as the land on either side of the road belongs to the city they are free to do whatever without any permits.
I am looking for a legal answer to the following question in light of this information:
     Page 2 of 636

 Is such major expansion without permits allowed if the other party owns land next to BCCP. Or is there a special get-away for City officials to do so?
Have the city engineers done the changes to structure within their allowed limits when expanding the road?
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX. I have also sent pictures of expansion and 0 distance between the road and BCCP land earlier to the official BCCP Email but have not gotten any reply.
I have also seen significantly fewer incidents of spotting wildlife and birds in and around my property which may be a result of this construction.
So to contrast what is there in actuality and what is on the BCCP site, I am sending screen shorts and links to google earth. The BCCP image shows that there is a clearance between land and road, and google earth shows 0 distance.

Thank you for inquiring about what steps you might need to develop your site. Our program works with landowners and developers to help with Endangered Species Act compliance in western Travis County through an expedited applicaOon and cerOficate process under the BCCP.
The best way to do this is to submit an applicaOon to our program: hips://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/Docs/applicaOon.pdf. You can email me for guidance in filling out the applicaOon if you need to. The applicaOon is simple and the main piece of informaOon that I need is the tax parcel ID; or survey, if it has recently been subdivided.
With informaOon you provide, we use TCAD parcel informaOon and the parOcipaOon zone maps to provide a response back to you with the following: a habitat determinaOon map, any condiOons that may apply if you choose to parOcipate, a quote for miOgaOon costs, and/or next steps and opOons. You can check what habitat fee zones are within your project area using our webmap: hips://arcg.is/0Pqbjb [arcg.is] To use the webmap, search your property using your address or TCAD ID. This map is best viewed on a Desktop computer. Or, if you prefer, you can check on the staOc maps showing habitat zones here: hips://www.traviscountytx.gov/maps. We also use the TCAD parcel informaOon to check to be sure that your site has not already been miOgated or paid for, through our process or a separate US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 10(a) permit. The applicaOon and our response do not commit you to any acOon – this is a service we provide to help inform your opOons. This part of the process – from receipt of your applicaOon to our response – typically takes 15 or fewer days. More informaOon on the process can be found on our website.
Aper you receive our response leier, we encourage you to review the opOons and email us for any quesOons. If you can parOcipate through our process (only a few sites cannot), you can noOfy us if you are ready to pay the miOgaOon and we will prepare and send a contract for you to sign; you will sign and return with your payment; we will issue the ParOcipaOon CerOficate to you and record with the County Clerk. The cerOficate goes with the property, not the person; so, if you sell the site in the future, the new landowner is covered for development within the same parcel.
       Page 5 of 636

  You do not have to parOcipate with us – you may apply for an ESA 10(a)(1)(B) permit through the local USFWS office by contacOng Paige Najvar at, (512) 490-0057 extension 229, or paige_najvar@fws.gov. Obtaining a USFWS permit can be a lengthy process and entails developing a Habitat ConservaOon Plan including mulOple year species surveys, a miOgaOon proposal, going through a public involvement process, and meeOng all the permit issuance criteria.
Thanks for contacOng Travis County for informaOon. Please feel free to call me if you have any quesOons. I look forward to helping you find an answer to fit your needs.

If a Builder, a city, or person has land next** to BCCP, do they need permission to construct Major construction such as DAM, ROAD, Ecommerce Warehouses, etc?
Note**: The land, in this case, does not belong to BCCP but is directly attached to BCCP land i.e. distance between them is 0 ft. away from BCCP.
Q(2)
If the participation contract is NOT signed and a BCCP permit (sometimes referred to as BCCP Participation Certificate) is NOT issued, then what is the legal action that BCCP Oaths to take? Is there a section of the law that can be referred or can I be connected with a legal attorney overlooking BCCP legal in this regard?

Thanks Mr. Lance.
I worked with BCCP to see if there were any wrongdoings and they found nothing, so I will be submitting my request in the coming few days.
But before I do so, I will like to clarify why I was investigating engineers' wrongdoing w.r.t BCCP too.
Wildlife has no representation other than us. The City and Engineers decided to construct a major artery road next to wildlife here. All of us know that a drunk driver has an equal chance of entering with a 18 wheeler into wildlife, and noise+pollution will drastically affect wildlife too. A notice or permit may have forced BCCP, Lawmakers and City Engineers to study the situation and maybe look for mitigating some problems we will soon see in the next few decades. That never happened. Now BCCP officials are okay to overlook this (probably they cannot do much, similar to TBPE that cannot act on city engineers).
We combined our responsibilities for the preservation of the wildlife and somehow everyone has neglected it to the extent that they can.
Do you know what will happen just outside this BCCP land in the next 2 to 3 years. The land at 1431 and Anderson-mill road intersection is sold to HEB and AMAZON to make huge mega warehouses. Trucks will run 7x24. AMAZON has already started rolling out things that will make them the savior of wildlife.
https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22686696/jeff-bezos-amazon-billionaires-biodiversity-conservation? campaign_id=0&emc=edit_cr_20210929&instance_id=0&nl=comments- notifications&regi_id=154276465&segment_id=0&user_id=6cc7db1a85510cad9cfd2f40c7bcbcc1
I may leave this place in the next 2 or 3 years, but the road will not leave. It will sit and kill because of lack of safety, but also because of generated noise and pollution.

Regarding your two quesOons – we are not asking that one prove a negaOve. However, we do understand that a crux of your issue is that a study was not done (absence of a report) and you believe there should have been one. In that case, it would be important for us to understand where the requirement is (if you know) that states a study was required. Is there a city ordinance, or TXDOT requirement, etc. If this is a best-pracOce situaOon rather than a code or ordinance requirement, then that informaOon would be helpful as well.

  As for safety issues – No, of course we do not want anything dangerous to happen to anyone and a fatality is absolutely not required for an issue to be reviewed. If you wish to send in informaOon from your wife, that is fine if it as a personal opinion (vs a sealed report) as she is not a PE in Texas and we don’t want to run into sealing / rule issues. Support from specific codes, etc. is helpful . Also any other engineering analyses or info you might have would be helpful.
You noted the BCCP requirements. Is this for the roadway or power poles, etc? It would be helpful to understand this piece as well. Is the contenOon basically that the city was required to do a BCCP permit for the road itself?
One final comment – since a complaint is against a specific engineer, please provide your informaOon in the context of what that engineer did or was responsible for. For example, if a design error was made, point out how you think that engineer was related to the error. If a study was not done, how was the engineer responsible, etc. This will help with specifying potenOal violaOons.

Dear Mr. Lance.
Thanks for the email and I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs
I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following: 1. You said - "Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an
"absence of necessary safety calculaOons" to produce a safe design?
Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not pracOce the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculaOons?
a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculaOons done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a leier to support that without calculaOons the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 p spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?
     2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that

 2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that s/he did consider these at the "design" phase to cater to need of the FEDERAL agency here. What shall I be asking them to produce?

As we have previously discussed, we can provide some guidance on filing a complaint and what is needed and helpful to have a complaint move forward. I’d be happy to assist.
A couple of things to note at the start – I cannot file the complaint for you; you’ll need to complete the appropriate form and submit any evidence you have. Also, by providing this guidance it does not mean that we are for or against any party in a complaint, nor does it infer that we will find in favor or against any parOcular person or enOty as part of a case. We can open a case per our laws and rules and we will processes it to its appropriate conclusion.
That being said, you noted that you wish to proceed with a complaint against the design engineer. For any complaint, we need to meet a few parOcular thresholds: a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potenOal violaOons should be as specific as possible; the potenOal violaOons must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering; and there must be supporOng evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdicOon to invesOgate or take acOon and if there is a potenOal violaOon to more forward with.
   Page 12 of 636

  To go through these a bit more:
Rule or Law violaOons: please list the rules you think this individual may have violated. You don’t need to be an aiorney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direcOon on why you think this person did something wrong. In addiOon, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specificaOon, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules – please note that. For example, if you think a person did not follow a naOonal design specificaOon or guidance, please let us know which one(s). For contrast: only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direcOon for an invesOgaOon and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated secOon XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of AusOn’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
The rule or law violaOons should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad. For example, a design plan that has errors that you can idenOfy and is signed by a specific PE may be a violaOon, but a general accusaOon that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that informaOon.
A violaOon must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering. This determines if the board has jurisdicOon to pursue the complaint. A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal acOon and should be handled by the police. On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their pracOce of professional engineering.
The last piece is evidence: if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can. If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that. If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well. Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an invesOgaOon because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court). In addiOon to this, TBPELS does not go on ‘fishing expediOons’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or enOty and then search for potenOal violaOons. We need somewhere specific to focus. That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.
If we get this kind of informaOon, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdicOon to move forward, and then conOnue with an invesOgaOon.
I hope these points are helpful. Sincerely,

On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good apernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submiied to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maiers
      Page 16 of 636

    under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beier equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.

    For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the
complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
        Page 20 of 636

      2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
   Page 21 of 636

       I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City
    Page 32 of 636

                of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

CC: Michael Sims <Michael.Sims@pels.texas.gov>
Good apernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submiied to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not
   Page 39 of 636

have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maiers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beier equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
 Page 40 of 636

For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
       Page 43 of 636

  3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had
   Page 44 of 636

   violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then

on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees
        with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
          Page 58 of 636

                 Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight

               road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi,
BCCP documents talk of "permits" to create and develop a structure that is more than 3000 sqft (Major structure is coined in BCCP documents as 3000 sq. ft) near or inside BCCP land. These are covered under - US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b)
Q(1)
If a Builder, a city, or person has land next** to BCCP, do they need permission to construct Major construction such as DAM, ROAD, Ecommerce Warehouses, etc?
Note**: The land, in this case, does not belong to BCCP but is directly attached to BCCP land i.e. distance between them is 0 ft. away from BCCP.
Q(2)
If the participation contract is NOT signed and a BCCP permit (sometimes referred to as BCCP Participation Certificate) is NOT issued, then what is the legal action that BCCP Oaths to take? Is there a section of the law that can be referred or can I be connected with a legal attorney overlooking BCCP legal in this regard?

Dear Mr. Sims:
Kindly add the 2 videos to the existing proofs that I have submitted "showing that curb is not a safe enough safeguard and even a small car (leave aside huge trucks) can break past them to hit anyone who may be walking on the side of the road".
Secondly, I also think that investigating officer(s) may need clarification on claims that I made that says that over the last 25 yrs the Licensed PE engineers may have our of *negligence* been responsible for more than 2500+ people road-deaths (I think I compared it with the count of Americans that lost life in Afghanistan in 20+ yrs there). You must additionally add the calculations that I sent the other day (email below) that show how I came to that conclusion. My basis of assumption stems right from Mr. Darwin's written email that he nor anyone he knows as PE have ever practiced calculations or estimations as defined by TBPE guidelines. They are trained to *never* bypass safety but looks like they all did. I have already submitted the email from Mr. Darwin in my original submission.
If you have the email address of the investigating officer that you can share, then I can most likely request any new requests (similar to the above 2 requests) directly to him/her.
Lastly, I want to know when can I expect some decision in this case. ---

The curb is the only safety the city gave to me, and it means ZERO SAFETY.
The fence of BCCP is destroyed, and if it would have been a bigger truck, then wildlife is also be in danger. Coming back to my side, It could be a pedestrian's death if it happened on my side of the property. There is 0 space for them to move once such a situation happens.

missed adding a section that does calculate how bad design within texas may have killed more than 3000+ Americans in the last 25+. yrs *IF* what Mr. Darwin (PE/Cedar Park) is true in saying that hundreds of Licensed PE engineers do not practice to either comply with TBPE guidelines and either does calculations/estimates themselves or make the designer companies that do them.
Basically, the calculation assumed that 5 to 10% of road fatalities are due to design issues. (Not arguing on the design cost).
      Page 64 of 636

  A rough figure says 10K lose life in texas road accidents every year, so per year, 500 to 1000 are because of the absence of design. Scale it to 25 yrs (as Mr. Darwin PE/Cedar Park) has suggested, and you get this astronomical number. Now, even if you take 2 to 3% as a reasonable rate, then also we have lost more Texans on road due to such absence of engineering than the total we lost in the Afgan war. I have recently written the same details to the office of the president of the USA and still have to hear back from them (I may be sending a reminder there too). It is said that all this has to come from a non- engineer and no one within the engineering community stood to safeguard the very thing that makes their identity.

Hi DOT.GOV:
Around 2 months back I submitted to your hotline facts and proofs explaining how many city officials in most of texas are
ignoring safety and are fooling the public of the USA with fraud estimation documents.
I got directly affected by 1 project and a few city engineers but the point I raised is not limited to 1 engineer, 1 project, or 1 city. In theory, this may be going on more widespread than you may think. I am not going to judge this, but for sure history will. After all, many of these so-called "engineers" (mostly with hollow or shallow knowledge) will soon work for the US-led trillion $$ Infra project and showcase to the world how this is done.
In the last 20 yrs, this single fact may have in total killed more Americans than what this country lost in Afgan war in 20 yrs. And in the end, is there any justice to the plaintiff here?
Is there any justice for me? I will like to know if you are doing "anything" with this complaint and substance I have provided or was it just a unfortunate form-filling task that I did with a dead-end ahead of me?

Mr. Kalra,
We received this Hotline Complaint from you regarding allegaOons that the City of Cedar Park is “building roads without any safety calculaOons”. However, there was nothing to support any of the allegaOons or your claims.
What type of “safety calculaOons” are not being done by the City of Cedar Park?
[SandeepK] The city engineers, and contract firms decided to pull the road next to residents property (earlier the distance was 35ft + walkway of 7 feet, and now at some point as close as 11 feet with only safety of a 6 inch curb. City also removed 50+ yrs old trees that were also acting as protection) but did not follow PE guidelines and did "no"(none, zero) engineering safety calculation as per TBPE guidelines (Proof: https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/enf_pub.pdf, section 1001.003, 137.33 e, and lookup word "calculations") such as what kind of vehicle and what speed is safe for this kind of structure. They were supposed to use physics, and maths to do safety calculations. Instead they only did "accounting estimates" and posted them against estimates. One of the sides of the road is open to winds as it faces BCCP land and there is no structure there. YouTube is filled with videos such as these (one such Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG22JlcZnMk) that shows that high wind will make 18 wheelers fly. With no barrier, or gap between property and road except walkway a high wind can cause catastrophe to pedestrians.
I also pointed out that the 18 wheelers had in the past converted a pebble on the road as a vehicle to destroy a brand new installed fence(proof attached as screen shot). Email to city engineers showed with picture proof how a pebble from a speeding truck tore the wooden fence. There could have been a kid in that spot.
A drunk driver on a truck also is a moving missile. I hope you do not want proof of this. You can fetch thousands of reports from any police department.
Video proof of such trucks travelling unlawfully in the locality (some caring fuel). Unfortunately the angle of installation fails to capture incoming traffic and mostly capture outgoing:

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof. For proof sake i am attaching just one of the email threads. They go really long.
                        Page 76 of 636

       Page 77 of 636

   The earlier distance between walkway to road distance would have prevented any of these 3 cases. A new structure was implemented when I raised the concerns in writing (concerns.pdf, proof attached) with all these points raised. Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been
 Page 78 of 636

 involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allegaOons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calculaOons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
What acOon do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allegaOons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid
   Page 79 of 636

 possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road.
2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place.
5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.
In order for us to consider these claims, please provide any supporOng informaOon or documentaOon. Thank you,

DescripOon of the fraud, waste, and/or abuse:
Fraud & Abuse of powers - This may apply to a lot of US ciOes in Texas, but certainly my city - Cedar Park TX (78613) is one, and the Omeframe of the abuse menOoned here goes in YEARS *25+ years*.
The city engineers have been building roads without any safety calculaOons. They outsource drawings from other firms where also there are no safety calculaOons done. City engineers (Licensed and unlicensed combined) do not push the firms to do the calculaOons.
T.B.P.E (Texas Board of PE Engineers) was contacted in this respect too, but they said that they cannot rule over decisions made by city P.E. engineers. This has been happening from last 25+ years in Cedar Park. From the sense of interacOon with city and TBPE it seems not wrong to assume that this has been pracOce in a lot texas ciOes. (Cannot say for sure for other ciOes - but they were not surprised by the learnings). On asking for calculaOons, city provided me with what Engineers has been submiÄng as "calculaOons" and "esOmates" and it was actually "accounOng calculaOons". Cedar Park TX is just 20 miles from AusOn capital. You can extrapolate to see what is the level of engineering fraud going on.
All data menOoned by me above here is backed by FOIA, and wriien communicaOon with TBPE, Cedar Park City Council, Cedar Park City Engineers. I can present my data if needed. More so, the cedar park city has not indicated to me that they will take any acOon w.r.t this.
I as a student am also interested in running Machine learning regression algo. to find the correlaOon but could not find dataset on your website NHSTA w.r.t. any accident studies done where the correlaOon to this parameters were studied. I will equally be interested in finding the data to run models myself (if anything or this sort was collected earlier). In case there is data available, then i will like to see that data.

Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allegaOons being made?
Page 89 of 636

On what type of roads or projects are these allegaOons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calculaOons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
What acOon do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allegaOons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road.
2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place.
   Page 90 of 636

5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.

What type of “safety calculaOons” are not being done by the City of Cedar Park?
[SandeepK] The city engineers, and contract firms decided to pull the road next to residents property (earlier the distance was 35ft + walkway of 7 feet, and now at some point as close as 11 feet with only safety of a 6 inch curb. City also removed 50+ yrs old trees that were also acting as protection) but did not follow PE guidelines and did "no"(none, zero) engineering safety calculation as per TBPE guidelines (Proof: https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/enf_pub.pdf, section 1001.003, 137.33 e, and lookup word "calculations") such as what kind of vehicle and what speed is safe for this kind of structure. They were supposed to use physics, and maths to do safety calculations. Instead they only did "accounting estimates" and posted them against estimates. One of the sides of the road is open to winds as it faces BCCP land and there is no structure there. YouTube is filled with videos such as these (one such Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG22JlcZnMk) that shows that high wind will make 18 wheelers fly. With no barrier, or gap between property and road except walkway a high wind can cause catastrophe to pedestrians.
I also pointed out that the 18 wheelers had in the past converted a pebble on the road as a vehicle to destroy a brand new installed fence(proof attached as screen shot). Email to city engineers showed with picture proof how a pebble from a speeding truck tore the wooden fence. There could have been a kid in that spot.
A drunk driver on a truck also is a moving missile. I hope you do not want proof of this. You can fetch thousands of reports from any police department.
Video proof of such trucks travelling unlawfully in the locality (some caring fuel). Unfortunately the angle of installation fails to capture incoming traffic and mostly capture outgoing:

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof.

The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been

The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof. For proof sake i am attaching just one of the email threads. They go really long.
                       Page 103 of 636

      Page 104 of 636

   The earlier distance between walkway to road distance would have prevented any of these 3 cases. A new structure was implemented when I raised the concerns in writing (concerns.pdf, proof attached) with all these points raised. Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the
Page 105 of 636

engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allegaOons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calculaOons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
What acOon do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allegaOons?
   [SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
Page 106 of 636

1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road. 2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place. 5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.

 “building roads without any safety calculaOons”. However, there was nothing to support any of the allegaOons or your claims.
What type of “safety calculaOons” are not being done by the City of Cedar Park?
[SandeepK] The city engineers, and contract firms decided to pull the road next to residents property (earlier the distance was 35ft + walkway of 7 feet, and now at some point as close as 11 feet with only safety of a 6 inch curb. City also removed 50+ yrs old trees that were also acting as protection) but did not follow PE guidelines and did "no"(none, zero) engineering safety calculation as per TBPE guidelines (Proof: https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/enf_pub.pdf, section 1001.003, 137.33 e, and lookup word "calculations") such as what kind of vehicle and what speed is safe for this kind of structure. They were supposed to use physics, and maths to do safety calculations. Instead they only did "accounting estimates" and posted them against estimates. One of the sides of the road is open to winds as it faces BCCP land and there is no structure there. YouTube is filled with videos such as these (one such Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG22JlcZnMk) that shows that high wind will make 18 wheelers fly. With no barrier, or gap between property and road except walkway a high wind can cause catastrophe to pedestrians.
I also pointed out that the 18 wheelers had in the past converted a pebble on the road as a vehicle to destroy a brand new installed fence(proof attached as screen shot). Email to city engineers showed with picture proof how a pebble from a speeding truck tore the wooden fence. There could have been a kid in that spot.
A drunk driver on a truck also is a moving missile. I hope you do not want proof of this. You can fetch thousands of reports from any police department.
Video proof of such trucks travelling unlawfully in the locality (some caring fuel). Unfortunately the angle of installation fails to capture incoming traffic and mostly capture outgoing:

                 Page 119 of 636

   been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last
25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
         Page 120 of 636

   I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

     sorry I sent an email too soon. I wanted to add this
There were some end-results from the communication with some teams (though not very fruitful)
[1] BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2] TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3] In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.
[4] Engineers have verbally confessed that the safety on the property is less than other 9 properties. and without commitment said If they have resources then they may try to fix things.

Dear Sir/Madam:
   Page 123 of 636

      I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side
 Page 124 of 636

      but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20A
ssessment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

Subject: Re: Noise Complaints from Anderson Mill Rd.
Mr. Sam:
Thanks for the clarificaOon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?
ArOcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or aiached to the motor vehicle.
         Page 126 of 636

   o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Ores on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaOons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
I am not a legal expert and I will try geÄng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.
I am available mostly on Fridays aper 2:00 PM. I will only come if the session is fully recorded (Audio and Video) that I will also get access to it, and will like to know the parOcipant's name 2 days before hand.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayOme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) NighÄme: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
     The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise
 Page 129 of 636

     level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
      So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides

    (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov- 15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on

Subject: Re: NoOce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecOvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaOon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepOng the deal of
               Page 134 of 636

       just a higher (addiOonal 2 p) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriOng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of buiercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acOon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraOon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuOon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opOons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 p wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaOon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriOng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 p wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriOng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 p wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 p at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beier to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaOons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiOonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 p wooden fence only aper making sure that the plan is safe.
 Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current
Page 135 of 636

       Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15p) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaOons when we met the city for the first Ome in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is aiached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecOon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaOonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenOal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaOons based on models developed using mathemaOcs, science and past experiences from similar
situaOons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluOon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properOes in the similar situaOon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe
journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I lep as an easement for uOlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 d high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 p wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 p away from the road with no protecOon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as

       close as 6 p. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaOonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind
enough to not see the 3-4 p barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 p high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeOng with details) that they will give at least 3 p barrier and retenOon wall to all properOes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesOon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unOl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secOons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaOons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepOng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusOn-City to give part of the land that AusOn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let
us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 p margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were
 Page 137 of 636

       taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 p. Max distance is 9 p from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 p, and the Max distance is at 10 p from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 p. Farthest is 20+ p.

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight,
etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
           Page 141 of 636

  Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

There were some end-results from the communication with some teams (though not very fruitful)
[1] BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2] TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3] In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the
   Page 144 of 636

     project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Asse
ssment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10
   Page 145 of 636

     families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

Mr. Sam:
Thanks for the clarificaOon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?
ArOcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or aiached to the motor vehicle.

  o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Ores on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaOons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
I am not a legal expert and I will try geÄng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.
I am available mostly on Fridays aper 2:00 PM. I will only come if the session is fully recorded (Audio and Video) that I will also get access to it, and will like to know the parOcipant's name 2 days before hand.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayOme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) NighÄme: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
      Page 149 of 636

    Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this
property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
               Page 150 of 636

  And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a
masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here.

Subject: Re: NoOce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
                  Page 152 of 636

      -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecOvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaOon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepOng the deal of just a higher (addiOonal 2 p) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriOng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of buiercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acOon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraOon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuOon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opOons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 p wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaOon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriOng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 p wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriOng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 p wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier
 of 3 p at the roadside.
Page 153 of 636

      of 3 p at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beier to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaOons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiOonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 p wooden fence only aper making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15p) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaOons when we met the city for the first Ome in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is aiached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecOon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaOonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenOal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaOons based on models developed using mathemaOcs, science and past experiences from similar situaOons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluOon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properOes in the similar situaOon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family
 Page 154 of 636

      will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I lep as an easement for uOlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 d high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 p wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 p away from the road with no protecOon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 p. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaOonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 p barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 p high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeOng with details) that they will give at least 3 p barrier and retenOon wall to all properOes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesOon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unOl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secOons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaOons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepOng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusOn-City to give part of the land that AusOn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
 Page 155 of 636

      They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 p margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 p. Max distance is 9 p from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 p, and the Max distance is at 10 p from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 p. Farthest is 20+ p.

 Dear Ms. Gloria,
It will be kind of you if you can help me by arranging possible tesOng for environmental studies on my property to find out levels of pollutants and noise etc. as i have not been able to convince any other party(city, engineers, or compliance) to even answer the request.

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to
the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk
away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and
          Page 159 of 636

 more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

sorry I sent an email too soon. I wanted to add this
There were some end-results from the communication with some teams (though not very fruitful)
[1] BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2] TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3] In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.
[4] Engineers have verbally confessed that the safety on the property is less than other 9 properties. and without commitment said If they have resources then they may try to fix things.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a
   Page 162 of 636

    road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Assess
ment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.

Mr. Sam:
Thanks for the clarificaOon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?
ArOcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or aiached to the motor vehicle.
o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Ores on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaOons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.

 I am not a legal expert and I will try geÄng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayOme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) NighÄme: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.

Subject: Re: NoOce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
               Page 168 of 636

 I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoOce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient. -- Decision --
                  Page 170 of 636

     We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric^ons to enter our property s^ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecOvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra^onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaOon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepOng the deal of just a higher (addiOonal 2 p) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriOng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of buiercup creek, Cedar Park, TX)
and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acOon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraOon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuOon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opOons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 p wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaOon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriOng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 p wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriOng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 p wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 p at the roadside.
 [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beier to
Page 171 of 636

     [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beier to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaOons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiOonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 p wooden fence only aper making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15p) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaOons when we met the city for the first Ome in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is aiached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecOon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaOonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenOal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple specula^ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ^me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaOons based on models developed using mathemaOcs, science and past experiences from similar situaOons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluOon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properOes in the similar situaOon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I lep as an easement for uOlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi^onal 2 d high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 p wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
 Page 172 of 636

     My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 p away from the road with no protecOon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 p. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaOonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 p barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 p high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiÄng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeOng with details) that they will give at least 3 p barrier and retenOon wall to all properOes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesOon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unOl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secOons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaOons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepOng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusOn-City to give part of the land that AusOn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
 Page 173 of 636

     -- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 p margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 p. Max distance is 9 p from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee^ng point: Min is 9 p, and the Max distance is at 10 p from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 p. Farthest is 20+ p.

Dear Mr. Lance, Mr. Sims, and City Officials:
A very timely article to share to you and city: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58740362
It is not far when you may see a similar article listing some wildlife from BCCP/FWS land.

I worked with BCCP to see if there were any wrongdoings and they found nothing, so I will be submitting my request in the coming few days.
But before I do so, I will like to clarify why I was investigating engineers' wrongdoing w.r.t BCCP too.
Wildlife has no representation other than us. The City and Engineers decided to construct a major artery road next to wildlife here. All of us know that a drunk driver has an equal chance of entering with a 18 wheeler into wildlife, and noise+pollution will drastically affect wildlife too. A notice or permit may have forced BCCP, Lawmakers and City Engineers to study the situation and maybe look for mitigating some problems we will soon see in the next few decades. That never happened. Now BCCP officials are okay to overlook this (probably they cannot do much, similar to TBPE that cannot act on city engineers).
We combined our responsibilities for the preservation of the wildlife and somehow everyone has neglected it to the extent that they can.
Do you know what will happen just outside this BCCP land in the next 2 to 3 years. The land at 1431 and Anderson-mill road intersection is sold to HEB and AMAZON to make huge mega warehouses. Trucks will run 7x24. AMAZON has already started rolling out things that will make them the savior of wildlife.
https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22686696/jeff-bezos-amazon-billionaires-biodiversity-conservation? campaign_id=0&emc=edit_cr_20210929&instance_id=0&nl=comments- notifications&regi_id=154276465&segment_id=0&user_id=6cc7db1a85510cad9cfd2f40c7bcbcc1
I may leave this place in the next 2 or 3 years, but the road will not leave. It will sit and kill because of lack of safety, but also because of generated noise and pollution.
Thanks, Sandeep Kalra

Regarding your two quesOons – we are not asking that one prove a negaOve. However, we do understand that a crux of your issue is that a study was not done (absence of a report) and you believe there should have been one. In that case, it would be important for us to understand where the requirement is (if you know) that states a study was required. Is there a city ordinance, or TXDOT requirement, etc. If this is a best-pracOce situaOon rather than a code or ordinance requirement, then that informaOon would be helpful as well.
As for safety issues – No, of course we do not want anything dangerous to happen to anyone and a fatality is absolutely not required for an issue to be reviewed. If you wish to send in informaOon from your wife, that is fine if it as a personal opinion (vs a sealed report) as she is not a PE in Texas and we don’t want to run into sealing / rule issues. Support from specific codes, etc. is helpful . Also any other engineering analyses or info you might have would be helpful.
You noted the BCCP requirements. Is this for the roadway or power poles, etc? It would be helpful to understand this piece as well. Is the contenOon basically that the city was required to do a BCCP permit for the road itself?
One final comment – since a complaint is against a specific engineer, please provide your informaOon in the context of what that engineer did or was responsible for. For example, if a design error was made, point out how you think that engineer was related to the error. If a study was not done, how was the engineer responsible, etc. This will help with specifying potenOal violaOons.
I appreciate your assistance in these maiers. Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Lance.
Thanks for the email and I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs
I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following:
1. You said - "Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an "absence of necessary safety calculaOons" to produce a safe design?
        Page 179 of 636

  Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not pracOce the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculaOons?
a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculaOons done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a leier to support that without calculaOons the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 p spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?
2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that s/he did consider these at the "design" phase to cater to need of the FEDERAL agency here. What shall I be asking them to produce?
I am attaching specific slides from BCCP presentation

On Wed, Sep 15, 2021 at 10:13 AM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good morning Mr. Kalra,
As we have previously discussed, we can provide some guidance on filing a complaint and what is needed and helpful to have a complaint move forward. I’d be happy to assist.
   Page 181 of 636

   A couple of things to note at the start – I cannot file the complaint for you; you’ll need to complete the appropriate form and submit any evidence you have. Also, by providing this guidance it does not mean that we are for or against any party in a complaint, nor does it infer that we will find in favor or against any parOcular person or enOty as part of a case. We can open a case per our laws and rules and we will processes it to its appropriate conclusion.
That being said, you noted that you wish to proceed with a complaint against the design engineer. For any complaint, we need to meet a few parOcular thresholds: a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potenOal violaOons should be as specific as possible; the potenOal violaOons must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering; and there must be supporOng evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdicOon to invesOgate or take acOon and if there is a potenOal violaOon to more forward with.
To go through these a bit more:
Rule or Law violaOons: please list the rules you think this individual may have violated. You don’t need to be an aiorney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direcOon on why you think this person did something wrong. In addiOon, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specificaOon, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules – please note that. For example, if you think a person did not follow a naOonal design specificaOon or guidance, please let us know which one(s). For contrast: only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direcOon for an invesOgaOon and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated secOon XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of AusOn’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
The rule or law violaOons should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad. For example, a design plan that has errors that you can idenOfy and is signed by a specific PE may be a violaOon, but a general accusaOon that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that informaOon.
A violaOon must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering. This determines if the board has jurisdicOon to pursue the complaint. A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal acOon and should be handled by the police. On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their pracOce of professional engineering.
The last piece is evidence: if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can. If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that. If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well. Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an invesOgaOon because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court). In addiOon to this, TBPELS does not go on ‘fishing expediOons’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or enOty and then search for potenOal violaOons. We need somewhere specific to focus. That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.
If we get this kind of informaOon, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdicOon to move forward, and then conOnue with an invesOgaOon.

   I understand your point of view and I have decided to go and ask for invesOgaOon for safety in drawings made by the PE engineers for Anderson Mill Rd expansion project. I know from my past email exchanges with you that TBPE may help me write the request for invesOgaOon. I will like to get some help there in this regards. This may be my first step for asking to fix this crap facade that is built with zero knowledge of safety for travelers and resident.
Please suggest how to go about it. Thanks

On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good apernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re- set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates
       Page 185 of 636

     TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submiied to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maiers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beier equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things.
 Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or
Page 186 of 636

     Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
        There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any
 Page 189 of 636

       request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2. Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons. Michael Sims, P.E.

He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the
           Page 205 of 636

                    right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Thanks Mr. Lance.
I worked with BCCP to see if there were any wrongdoings and they found nothing, so I will be submitting my request in the coming few days.
But before I do so, I will like to clarify why I was investigating engineers' wrongdoing w.r.t BCCP too.
Wildlife has no representation other than us. The City and Engineers decided to construct a major artery road next to wildlife here. All of us know that a drunk driver has an equal chance of entering with a 18 wheeler into wildlife, and noise+pollution will drastically affect wildlife too. A notice or permit may have forced BCCP, Lawmakers and City Engineers to study the situation and maybe look for mitigating some problems we will soon see in the next few decades. That never happened. Now BCCP officials are okay to overlook this (probably they cannot do much, similar to TBPE that cannot act on city engineers).
We combined our responsibilities for the preservation of the wildlife and somehow everyone has neglected it to the extent that they can.
Do you know what will happen just outside this BCCP land in the next 2 to 3 years. The land at 1431 and Anderson-mill road intersection is sold to HEB and AMAZON to make huge mega warehouses. Trucks will run 7x24. AMAZON has already started rolling out things that will make them the savior of wildlife.
https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22686696/jeff-bezos-amazon-billionaires-biodiversity-conservation? campaign_id=0&emc=edit_cr_20210929&instance_id=0&nl=comments- notifications&regi_id=154276465&segment_id=0&user_id=6cc7db1a85510cad9cfd2f40c7bcbcc1
I may leave this place in the next 2 or 3 years, but the road will not leave. It will sit and kill because of lack of safety, but also because of generated noise and pollution.

Regarding your two quesOons – we are not asking that one prove a negaOve. However, we do understand that a crux of your issue is that a study was not done (absence of a report) and you believe there should have been one. In that case, it would be important for us to understand where the requirement is (if you know) that states a study was required. Is there a city ordinance, or TXDOT requirement, etc. If this is a best-pracOce situaOon rather than a code or ordinance requirement, then that informaOon would be helpful as well.
     Page 208 of 636

 As for safety issues – No, of course we do not want anything dangerous to happen to anyone and a fatality is absolutely not required for an issue to be reviewed. If you wish to send in informaOon from your wife, that is fine if it as a personal opinion (vs a sealed report) as she is not a PE in Texas and we don’t want to run into sealing / rule issues. Support from specific codes, etc. is helpful . Also any other engineering analyses or info you might have would be helpful.
You noted the BCCP requirements. Is this for the roadway or power poles, etc? It would be helpful to understand this piece as well. Is the contenOon basically that the city was required to do a BCCP permit for the road itself?
One final comment – since a complaint is against a specific engineer, please provide your informaOon in the context of what that engineer did or was responsible for. For example, if a design error was made, point out how you think that engineer was related to the error. If a study was not done, how was the engineer responsible, etc. This will help with specifying potenOal violaOons.
I appreciate your assistance in these maiers. Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Lance.
Thanks for the email and I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs
I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following: 1. You said - "Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an
"absence of necessary safety calculaOons" to produce a safe design?
Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not pracOce the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculaOons?
a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculaOons done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a leier to support that without calculaOons the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 p spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?
     2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that

 2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that s/he did consider these at the "design" phase to cater to need of the FEDERAL agency here. What shall I be asking them to produce?

As we have previously discussed, we can provide some guidance on filing a complaint and what is needed and helpful to have a complaint move forward. I’d be happy to assist.
A couple of things to note at the start – I cannot file the complaint for you; you’ll need to complete the appropriate form and submit any evidence you have. Also, by providing this guidance it does not mean that we are for or against any party in a complaint, nor does it infer that we will find in favor or against any parOcular person or enOty as part of a case. We can open a case per our laws and rules and we will processes it to its appropriate conclusion.
That being said, you noted that you wish to proceed with a complaint against the design engineer. For any complaint, we need to meet a few parOcular thresholds: a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potenOal violaOons should be as specific as possible; the potenOal violaOons must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering; and there must be supporOng evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdicOon to invesOgate or take acOon and if there is a potenOal violaOon to more forward with.
   Page 212 of 636

  To go through these a bit more:
Rule or Law violaOons: please list the rules you think this individual may have violated. You don’t need to be an aiorney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direcOon on why you think this person did something wrong. In addiOon, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specificaOon, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules – please note that. For example, if you think a person did not follow a naOonal design specificaOon or guidance, please let us know which one(s). For contrast: only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direcOon for an invesOgaOon and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated secOon XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of AusOn’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
The rule or law violaOons should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad. For example, a design plan that has errors that you can idenOfy and is signed by a specific PE may be a violaOon, but a general accusaOon that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that informaOon.
A violaOon must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering. This determines if the board has jurisdicOon to pursue the complaint. A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal acOon and should be handled by the police. On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their pracOce of professional engineering.
The last piece is evidence: if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can. If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that. If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well. Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an invesOgaOon because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court). In addiOon to this, TBPELS does not go on ‘fishing expediOons’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or enOty and then search for potenOal violaOons. We need somewhere specific to focus. That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.
If we get this kind of informaOon, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdicOon to move forward, and then conOnue with an invesOgaOon.
I hope these points are helpful. Sincerely,
Lance Kinney, Ph.D., P.E. ExecuOve Director

On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good apernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submiied to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maiers
      Page 216 of 636

    under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beier equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
 Page 217 of 636

    For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the
complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
        Page 220 of 636

      2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
   Page 221 of 636

       I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

          We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City
    Page 232 of 636

                of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.

Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am no

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing
fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are
                Page 239 of 636

generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low- income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
   Page 242 of 636

   Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.

I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

[2] TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3] In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.
[4] Engineers have verbally confessed that the safety on the property is less than other 9 properties. and without commitment said If they have resources then they may try to fix things.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed
   Page 254 of 636

   the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Assessm
ent%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.

The first things project planners do is decide if their project will occur within the range of a listed species. If so, they need to decide if their project may affect listed species or its habitat. If they do not decide that their project may affect a listed species, they are not required to provide any informaOon to us, so their assessment is largely up to their own professional judgement. Usually with the listed golden-cheeked warbler, they look to see if the project will necessitate clearing any trees that could serve as potenOal nesOng habitat. If the project is planned within an area that is already developed with roads and commercial or residenOal buildings and/or will not involve clearing addiOonal trees, there is a very small likelihood that their project would impact the warbler, so they probably wouldn't involve us. If they thought their project would result in an impact to the species, they would come to us for guidance at that point.

   What are few of the things a city "should" or "must" have done to conclude that their work does not have any impacts on federally listed species.
For e.g. [1] They may have done some geological survey around these habitats and species, [2] consulted with professors in some universities (Texas University, TAMU, Dallas University,..)
and more importantly how long back can these researchers go? (can they say that they surveyed 10 or 20 years ago and concluded this?)
At one point they told me that the layout of the road and its expansion was in 1950's planning, and geological surveys on impact of wildlife were done 15 yrs back.

I understand your concerns and I remember providing some informaOon to Travis County in response to your inquiries about this in January 2020.
To be clear, neither Travis County nor the City of AusOn BCCP programs have anything to do with the widening of Anderson Mill near your home. This was a City of Cedar Park project. City of Cedar Park projects are not eligible to parOcipate in the BCCP Permit for their Endangered Species Act habitat miOgaOon requirements. The BCCP can only provide habitat miOgaOon for eligible projects in Travis County and not in Williamson County.
The City of Cedar Park did coordinate throughout this project with the City of AusOn BCP faciliOes staff to make sure any fence damages during construcOon were taken care of and everything was repaired to our saOsfacOon. I went out to the site yesterday to inspect for any damages to the BCP property and didn’t see any. This project was completed a couple years ago and the adjacent BCP property has not been negaOvely impacted by it. This project has actually resulted in less damage to the preserve and habitat. As I understand it, the widening of Anderson Mill was, in part, a safety improvement project to smooth out some of the more dangerous curves in the road. Before the compleOon of this road widening project, there were many automobile collisions into our BCP fence which resulted in some habitat disturbance during repairs. Since this project was completed, there have not been any automobile/fence collisions on our BCP property.
In summary, the widening of this roadway did not violate the terms of the Balcones Canyonlands ConservaOon Plan and there has been no noOceable negaOve impacts to the adjacent Balcones Canyonlands Preserve. I do not believe there is anything the County or the City can do for you in this situaOon, and I don’t believe we have any addiOonal informaOon to supply regarding this completed Anderson Mill Road widening project by the City of Cedar Park.
If you are trying to figure out if this roadway improvement project was completed in compliance with the Federal Endangered Species Act, you may want to consider reaching out to the local US Fish and Wildlife AusOn Ecological Services office.

    The reason for writing this email was to bring to your knowledge that I have been tracking the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd (that the city of Cedar Park) did was next to BCCP land. They did *NOT* took any permissions with BCCP to construct the road. The road is now 0 cm away from the BCCP. The expansion has also impacted my property too. I have used the BCCP tools that you have given to highlight my property. The road that runs between my property and BCCP Land had ~25 ft distance on both sides, but now it is 0 with BCCP and that too without US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b). They also pushed the road next to my property and now it sits with just a 10 ft walkway in between.
When I inquired to City, the engineers told me(verbally) that as the land on either side of the road belongs to the city they are free to do whatever without any permits.
I am looking for a legal answer to the following question in light of this information:
Is such major expansion without permits allowed if the other party owns land next to BCCP. Or is there a special get-away for City officials to do so?
Have the city engineers done the changes to structure within their allowed limits when expanding the road?
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX. I have also sent pictures of expansion and 0 distance between the road and BCCP land earlier to the official BCCP Email but have not gotten any reply.
I have also seen significantly fewer incidents of spotting wildlife and birds in and around my property which may be a result of this construction.
    Page 262 of 636

    So to contrast what is there in actuality and what is on the BCCP site, I am sending screen shorts and links to google earth. The BCCP image shows that there is a clearance between land and road, and google earth shows 0 distance.

       Page 264 of 636

     Thank you for inquiring about what steps you might need to develop your site. Our program works with landowners and developers to help with Endangered Species Act compliance in western Travis County through an expedited applicaOon and cerOficate process under the BCCP.
The best way to do this is to submit an applicaOon to our program: hips://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/Docs/applicaOon.pdf. You can email me for guidance in filling out the applicaOon if you need to. The applicaOon is simple and the main piece of informaOon that I need is the tax parcel ID; or survey, if it has recently been subdivided.
With informaOon you provide, we use TCAD parcel informaOon and the parOcipaOon zone maps to provide a response back to you with the following: a habitat determinaOon map, any condiOons that may apply if you choose to parOcipate, a quote for miOgaOon costs, and/or next steps and opOons. You can check what habitat fee zones are within your project area using our webmap: hips://arcg.is/0Pqbjb [arcg.is] To use the webmap, search your property using your address or TCAD ID. This map is best viewed on a Desktop computer. Or, if you prefer, you can check on the staOc maps showing habitat zones here: hips://www.traviscountytx.gov/maps. We also use the TCAD parcel informaOon to check to be sure that your site has not already been miOgated or paid for, through our process or a separate US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 10(a) permit. The applicaOon and our response do not commit you to any acOon – this is a service we provide to help inform your opOons. This part of the process – from receipt of your applicaOon to our response – typically takes 15 or fewer days. More informaOon on the process can be found on our website.
Aper you receive our response leier, we encourage you to review the opOons and email us for any quesOons. If you can parOcipate through our process (only a few sites cannot), you can noOfy us if you are ready to pay the miOgaOon and we will prepare and send a contract for you to sign; you will sign and return with your payment; we will issue the ParOcipaOon CerOficate to you and record with the County Clerk. The cerOficate goes with the property, not the person; so, if you sell the site in the future, the new landowner is covered for development within the same parcel.
You do not have to parOcipate with us – you may apply for an ESA 10(a)(1)(B) permit through the local USFWS office by contacOng Paige Najvar at, (512) 490-0057 extension 229, or paige_najvar@fws.gov. Obtaining a USFWS permit can be a lengthy process and entails developing a Habitat ConservaOon Plan including mulOple year species surveys, a miOgaOon proposal, going through a public involvement process, and meeOng all the permit issuance criteria.
Thanks for contacOng Travis County for informaOon. Please feel free to call me if you have any quesOons. I look forward to helping you find an answer to fit your needs.

Hi,
BCCP documents talk of "permits" to create and develop a structure that is more than 3000 sqft (Major structure is coined in BCCP documents as 3000 sq. ft) near or inside BCCP land. These are covered under - US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b)
Q(1)
If a Builder, a city, or person has land next** to BCCP, do they need permission to construct Major construction such as DAM, ROAD, Ecommerce Warehouses, etc?
Note**: The land, in this case, does not belong to BCCP but is directly attached to BCCP land i.e. distance between them is 0 ft. away from BCCP.
Q(2)
If the participation contract is NOT signed and a BCCP permit (sometimes referred to as BCCP Participation Certificate) is NOT issued, then what is the legal action that BCCP Oaths to take? Is there a section of the law that can be referred or can I be connected with a legal attorney overlooking BCCP legal in this regard?

So to contrast what is there in actuality and what is on the BCCP site, I am sending screen shorts and links to google earth. The BCCP image shows that there is a clearance between land and road, and google earth shows 0 distance.

    Thank you for inquiring about what steps you might need to develop your site. Our program works with landowners and developers to help with Endangered Species Act compliance in western Travis County through an expedited applicaOon and cerOficate process under the BCCP.
The best way to do this is to submit an applicaOon to our program: hips://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/Docs/applicaOon.pdf. You can email me for guidance in filling out the applicaOon if you need to. The applicaOon is simple and the main piece of informaOon that I need is the tax parcel ID; or survey, if it has recently been subdivided.
With informaOon you provide, we use TCAD parcel informaOon and the parOcipaOon zone maps to provide a response back to you with the following: a habitat determinaOon map, any condiOons that may apply if you choose to parOcipate, a quote for miOgaOon costs, and/or next steps and opOons. You can check what habitat fee zones are within your project area using our webmap: hips://arcg.is/0Pqbjb [arcg.is] To use the webmap, search your property using your address or TCAD ID. This map is best viewed on a Desktop computer. Or, if you prefer, you can check on the staOc maps showing habitat zones here: hips://www.traviscountytx.gov/maps. We also use the TCAD parcel informaOon to check to be sure that your site has not already been miOgated or paid for, through our process or a separate US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 10(a) permit. The applicaOon and our response do not commit you to any acOon – this is a service we provide to help inform your opOons. This part of the process – from receipt of your applicaOon to our response – typically takes 15 or fewer days. More informaOon on the process can be found on our website.
Aper you receive our response leier, we encourage you to review the opOons and email us for any quesOons. If you can parOcipate through our process (only a few sites cannot), you can noOfy us if you are ready to pay the miOgaOon and we will prepare and send a contract for you to sign; you will sign and return with your payment; we will issue the ParOcipaOon CerOficate to you and record with the County Clerk. The cerOficate goes with the property, not the person; so, if you sell the site in the future, the new landowner is covered for development within the same parcel.
You do not have to parOcipate with us – you may apply for an ESA 10(a)(1)(B) permit through the local USFWS office by contacOng Paige Najvar at, (512) 490-0057 extension 229, or paige_najvar@fws.gov. Obtaining a USFWS permit can be a lengthy process and entails developing a Habitat ConservaOon Plan including mulOple year species surveys, a miOgaOon proposal, going through a public involvement process, and meeOng all the permit issuance criteria.
Thanks for contacOng Travis County for informaOon. Please feel free to call me if you have any quesOons. I look forward to helping you find an answer to fit your needs.

Hi,
BCCP documents talk of "permits" to create and develop a structure that is more than 3000 sqft (Major structure is coined in BCCP documents as 3000 sq. ft) near or inside BCCP land. These are covered under - US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b)
Q(1)
If a Builder, a city, or person has land next** to BCCP, do they need permission to construct Major construction such as DAM, ROAD, Ecommerce Warehouses, etc?
Note**: The land, in this case, does not belong to BCCP but is directly attached to BCCP land i.e. distance between them is 0 ft. away from BCCP.
Q(2)
If the participation contract is NOT signed and a BCCP permit (sometimes referred to as BCCP Participation Certificate) is NOT issued, then what is the legal action that BCCP Oaths to take?

sorry I sent an email too soon. I wanted to add this
There were some end-results from the communication with some teams (though not very fruitful)
[1] BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2] TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3] In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.
[4] Engineers have verbally confessed that the safety on the property is less than other 9 properties. and without commitment said If they have resources then they may try to fix things.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
   Page 280 of 636

  Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Assessme
nt%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
  I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

[2] In 2022, President Biden is rolling out infrastructure bill and will do road expansion. I plan to raise my voice in international forums once more if the engineers and compliance people from Texas are going to join because I genuinely believe that they will not a justice to service of America.

I understand your concerns and I remember providing some informaOon to Travis County in response to your inquiries about this in January 2020.
To be clear, neither Travis County nor the City of AusOn BCCP programs have anything to do with the widening of Anderson Mill near your home. This was a City of Cedar Park project. City of Cedar Park projects are not eligible to parOcipate in the BCCP Permit for their Endangered Species Act habitat miOgaOon requirements. The BCCP can only provide habitat miOgaOon for eligible projects in Travis County and not in Williamson County.
The City of Cedar Park did coordinate throughout this project with the City of AusOn BCP faciliOes staff to make sure any fence damages during construcOon were taken care of and everything was repaired to our saOsfacOon. I went out to the site yesterday to inspect for any damages to the BCP property and didn’t see any. This project was completed a couple years ago and the adjacent BCP property has not been negaOvely impacted by it. This project has actually resulted in less damage to the preserve and habitat. As I understand it, the widening of Anderson Mill was, in part, a safety improvement project to smooth out some of the more dangerous curves in the road. Before the compleOon of this road widening project, there were many automobile collisions into our BCP fence which resulted in some habitat disturbance during repairs. Since this project was completed, there have not been any automobile/fence collisions on our BCP property.
In summary, the widening of this roadway did not violate the terms of the Balcones Canyonlands ConservaOon Plan and there has been no noOceable negaOve impacts to the adjacent Balcones Canyonlands Preserve. I do not believe there is anything the County or the City can do for you in this situaOon, and I don’t believe we have any addiOonal informaOon to supply regarding this completed Anderson Mill Road widening project by the City of Cedar Park.
If you are trying to figure out if this roadway improvement project was completed in compliance with the Federal Endangered Species Act, you may want to consider reaching out to the local US Fish and Wildlife AusOn Ecological Services office.

  The reason for writing this email was to bring to your knowledge that I have been tracking the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd (that the city of Cedar Park) did was next to BCCP land. They did *NOT* took any permissions with BCCP to construct the road. The road is now 0 cm away from the BCCP. The expansion has also impacted my property too. I have used the BCCP tools that you have given to highlight my property. The road that runs between my property and BCCP Land had ~25 ft distance on both sides, but now it is 0 with BCCP and that too without US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b). They also pushed the road next to my property and now it sits with just a 10 ft walkway in between.
When I inquired to City, the engineers told me(verbally) that as the land on either side of the road belongs to the city they are free to do whatever without any permits.
I am looking for a legal answer to the following question in light of this information:
Is such major expansion without permits allowed if the other party owns land next to BCCP. Or is there a special get-away for City officials to do so?
Have the city engineers done the changes to structure within their allowed limits when expanding the road?
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX. I have also sent pictures of expansion and 0 distance between the road and BCCP land earlier to the official BCCP Email but have not gotten any reply.
I have also seen significantly fewer incidents of spotting wildlife and birds in and around my property which may be a result of this construction.

  The reason for writing this email was to bring to your knowledge that I have been tracking the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd (that the city of Cedar Park) did was next to BCCP land. They did *NOT* took any permissions with BCCP to construct the road. The road is now 0 cm away from the BCCP. The expansion has also impacted my property too. I have used the BCCP tools that you have given to highlight my property. The road that runs between my property and BCCP Land had ~25 ft distance on both sides, but now it is 0 with BCCP and that too without US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b). They also pushed the road next to my property and now it sits with just a 10 ft walkway in between.
When I inquired to City, the engineers told me(verbally) that as the land on either side of the road belongs to the city they are free to do whatever without any permits.
I am looking for a legal answer to the following question in light of this information:
Is such major expansion without permits allowed if the other party owns land next to BCCP. Or is there a special get-away for City officials to do so?
Have the city engineers done the changes to structure within their allowed limits when expanding the road?
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX. I have also sent pictures of expansion and 0 distance between the road and BCCP land earlier to the official BCCP Email but have not gotten any reply.
I have also seen significantly fewer incidents of spotting wildlife and birds in and around my property which may be a result of this construction.
     Page 295 of 636

  So to contrast what is there in actuality and what is on the BCCP site, I am sending screen shorts and links to google earth. The BCCP image shows that there is a clearance between land and road, and google earth shows 0 distance.

   The best way to do this is to submit an applicaOon to our program: hips://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/Docs/applicaOon.pdf. You can email me for guidance in filling out the applicaOon if you need to. The applicaOon is simple and the main piece of informaOon that I need is the tax parcel ID; or survey, if it has recently been subdivided.
With informaOon you provide, we use TCAD parcel informaOon and the parOcipaOon zone maps to provide a response back to you with the following: a habitat determinaOon map, any condiOons that may apply if you choose to parOcipate, a quote for miOgaOon costs, and/or next steps and opOons. You can check what habitat fee zones are within your project area using our webmap: hips://arcg.is/0Pqbjb [arcg.is] To use the webmap, search your property using your address or TCAD ID. This map is best viewed on a Desktop computer. Or, if you prefer, you can check on the staOc maps showing habitat zones here: hips://www.traviscountytx.gov/maps. We also use the TCAD parcel informaOon to check to be sure that your site has not already been miOgated or paid for, through our process or a separate US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 10(a) permit. The applicaOon and our response do not commit you to any acOon – this is a service we provide to help inform your opOons. This part of the process – from receipt of your applicaOon to our response – typically takes 15 or fewer days. More informaOon on the process can be found on our website.
Aper you receive our response leier, we encourage you to review the opOons and email us for any quesOons. If you can parOcipate through our process (only a few sites cannot), you can noOfy us if you are ready to pay the miOgaOon and we will prepare and send a contract for you to sign; you will sign and return with your payment; we will issue the ParOcipaOon CerOficate to you and record with the County Clerk. The cerOficate goes with the property, not the person; so, if you sell the site in the future, the new landowner is covered for development within the same parcel.
You do not have to parOcipate with us – you may apply for an ESA 10(a)(1)(B) permit through the local USFWS office by contacOng Paige Najvar at, (512) 490-0057 extension 229, or paige_najvar@fws.gov. Obtaining a USFWS permit can be a lengthy process and entails developing a Habitat ConservaOon Plan including mulOple year species surveys, a miOgaOon proposal, going through a public involvement process, and meeOng all the permit issuance criteria.
Thanks for contacOng Travis County for informaOon. Please feel free to call me if you have any quesOons. I look forward to helping you find an answer to fit your needs.

Hi,
BCCP documents talk of "permits" to create and develop a structure that is more than 3000 sqft (Major structure is coined in BCCP documents as 3000 sq. ft) near or inside BCCP land. These are covered under - US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b)
Q(1)
If a Builder, a city, or person has land next** to BCCP, do they need permission to construct Major construction such as DAM, ROAD, Ecommerce Warehouses, etc?
Note**: The land, in this case, does not belong to BCCP but is directly attached to BCCP land i.e. distance between them is 0 ft. away from BCCP.
Q(2)
If the participation contract is NOT signed and a BCCP permit (sometimes referred to as BCCP Participation Certificate) is NOT issued, then what is the legal action that BCCP Oaths to take? Is there a section of the law that can be referred or can I be connected with a legal attorney overlooking BCCP legal in this regard?
Q(3)
Whom(Person, Email) shall I get in touch with for legal questions related to the rights of BCCP land?

sorry I sent an email too soon. I wanted to add this
There were some end-results from the communication with some teams (though not very fruitful)
[1] BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2] TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3] In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.
[4] Engineers have verbally confessed that the safety on the property is less than other 9 properties. and without commitment said If they have resources then they may try to fix things.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.

 I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all:
*Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Assessment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

Thanks Paige. The project actually ended in 2019, so any documents from City must be on file. The city that did the development is "City of Cedar Park". And from FOIA I came to know that
they have not taken any permits 10(a)(1)(b) permit ---

I just started working on the BCCP, so I will need to look into the answers to your quesOons. But, the document at the link below is the latest set of infrastructure guidelines for the BCP. It is probably the best place to start looking.

Have you spoken with Kimberlee Harvey at the City of AusOn? She would either have the answers to your quesOons or know where to find them. Here is her contact informaOon:
Kimberlee C. Harvey
Environmental Conservation Program Manager
Secretary of the BCCP Coordinating Committee 512-972-1686 | Kimberlee.Harvey@austintexas.gov
Also, just to follow up a liile on your last email...since the City of AusOn is a permit holder of the BCCP HCP and its associated 10(a)(1)(b) permit and also the owner of the property where the road construcOon has taken place, I am assuming they cleared this project through the BCCP parOcipaOon process within the City. I will check more closely in their annual reports to us to see if they discuss it (and will send you a copy if I find it), but if they just did the construcOon, they may not report on it unOl this December. That may be why I am not finding anything about it yet.

Thanks Paige.
I am going through some slide presentations where the BCCP has highlighted infra permits.
I have 2 following questions
1. IS there a minimum distance a "roadway" must have to BCCP land?
2. If yes, how much. Can you point me to the right documents for the BCCP distance requirements and exceptions if any?

  Dear Katie,
Thank you for your response.
Dear Paige:
I am emailing this under FOIA and will like to share the information and get answers. The request is for parcel
CAD Property ID: 181963
Situs Address: LIME CREEK RD 78641 TCAD Acre: 76.03
GIS Acre: 75.77
Geo ID: 0183370101
More Information
The reason for writing this email was to bring to your knowledge that I have been tracking the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd (that the city of Cedar Park) did was next to BCCP land. They did *NOT* took any permissions with BCCP to construct the road. The road is now 0 cm away from the BCCP. The expansion has also impacted my property too. I have used the BCCP tools that you have given to highlight my property. The road that runs between my property and BCCP Land had ~25 ft distance on both sides, but now it is 0 with BCCP and that too without US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b). They also pushed the road next to my property and now it sits with just a 10 ft walkway in between.
When I inquired to City, the engineers told me(verbally) that as the land on either side of the road belongs to the city they are free to do whatever without any permits.
      corresponding records in our files yet. I will keep working on it this week.
  Page 314 of 636

  I am looking for a legal answer to the following question in light of this information:
Is such major expansion without permits allowed if the other party owns land next to BCCP. Or is there a special get-away for City officials to do so?
Have the city engineers done the changes to structure within their allowed limits when expanding the road?
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX. I have also sent pictures of expansion and 0 distance between the road and BCCP land earlier to the official BCCP Email but have not gotten any reply.
I have also seen significantly fewer incidents of spotting wildlife and birds in and around my property which may be a result of this construction.
So to contrast what is there in actuality and what is on the BCCP site, I am sending screen shorts and links to google earth. The BCCP image shows that there is a clearance between land and road, and google earth shows 0 distance.

On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good apernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
          Page 326 of 636

   The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submiied to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maiers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
 Page 327 of 636

   Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beier equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.

   I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

     Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?

     Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we

be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we
               disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.

The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day- 01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

Good morning Mr. Lance
I understand your point of view and I have decided to go and ask for invesOgaOon for safety in drawings made by the PE engineers for Anderson Mill Rd expansion project. I know from my past email exchanges with you that TBPE may help me write the request for invesOgaOon. I will like to get some help there in this regards. This may be my first step for asking to fix this crap facade that is built with zero knowledge of safety for travelers and resident.
Please suggest how to go about it. Thanks

On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good apernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
          Page 350 of 636

  First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submiied to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maiers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and
maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades /
 Page 351 of 636

  specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beier equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
         Page 354 of 636

    Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
      Page 365 of 636

              Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design
    Page 366 of 636

              criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

Please send me the link for TEPA And I may like to seek addiOonal informaOon from TBPE. I will likely come back asking for it. If you think you want to delegate this to Mr. Sims or someone then please let me know.
Thanks
On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good apernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submiied to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maiers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
  Page 373 of 636

 One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beier equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any
 Page 374 of 636

 parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that
      Page 377 of 636

   needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we
   Page 378 of 636

    ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)
Do you keep recordings of phone calls?

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence.

         relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
         Page 392 of 636

                  Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
      I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon

                 about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub- clauses.

CC: Michael Sims <Michael.Sims@pels.texas.gov>
Good apernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submiied to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not
   Page 397 of 636

have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maiers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beier equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
 Page 398 of 636

For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
       Page 401 of 636

  3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had
   Page 402 of 636

   violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then

on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees
        with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
          Page 416 of 636

                 Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight
       Page 417 of 636

               road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Are you available for coming down to the property and show us the 11 p distance that you talked about? Also, Please send a copy of the drawings (or bring it for us to scan it) of the road that shows the claimed distance from my property line.
My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 p from the property line.
Please give me the window when you can be available.

CC: Michael Sims <Michael.Sims@pels.texas.gov>
Good apernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submiied to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city
   Page 421 of 636

department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maiers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beier equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
 Page 422 of 636

 For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
        Page 425 of 636

  3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed
   Page 426 of 636

   that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later

That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
         Page 440 of 636

                 Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight

If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

CC: Michael Sims <Michael.Sims@pels.texas.gov>
Good apernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submiied to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city
   Page 445 of 636

department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maiers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beier equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
 Page 446 of 636

 For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
        Page 449 of 636

  3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later

I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
         Page 464 of 636

                 Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight

There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
        Page 469 of 636

  Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

                 When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and apernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

                    With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).
Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and guier to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and guier median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 p
fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
      Page 494 of 636

 1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

  It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

     We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

SecOon 1001.407 TBPE Guide for any license engineer working on "Public Work" must support his work with 3 parts (a) Plan (b) SpecificaOons and (3) EsOmates.
I am asking for the (b) and (c). They must be in your possession from the person who sealed the design plan.
Am I wrong in assuming that licensed engineers have to abide to the TBPE Rule guide?

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I
           Page 509 of 636

              menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.
Darwin

Subject: Re: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
         Page 510 of 636

                There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and apernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).
Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and guier to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and guier median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 p fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project
layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
  Page 517 of 636

 I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maier with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who

If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

          Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÄng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American
        Page 531 of 636

             AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Subject: Re: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ p distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 p siÄng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
     Page 534 of 636

                  The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and apernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).
Thanks.

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and guier to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your
   Page 535 of 636

                   property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and guier median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon.
The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 p fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
     Page 536 of 636

                    The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Mr. Sims:
PFA PDF copy w/ proofs of the complaint that was filed on January-17th of 2019. It was submitted to TBPE on my request by my wife (Deepshikha Kalra). The complaint was not electronic, so copy of that is attached.
The 2nd complaint was in the form of an email. It was submitted by me from my other email address (Anderson.Mill.Road@gmail.com) on Feb-22-2019 (Sorry I thought I did it in June, but it was in Feb)
The attachments are beyond the 25MB limit, so you may get a link to PDF. If TBPE Filters out these links then I am happy to send a copy of these in the mail. At a high level, In my complaints, I have highlighted how the engineers (not just Mr. Green, Mr. Darwin but all of those who have worked for Cedar Park and were involved in Anderson Mill Rd expansion) have not followed §1001.407 and have used no calculations what so ever for any public work. More so, they claim that this is the de-facto standard for them for the last 25 years. Given that 18 wheelers are now coming as close as 10 ft to my property and there are no calculations, nor comparisons make me worried every day!
Since 2019, we have also seen retaliation from Mr. Greens and Mr. Darwin (PE), and that will now be an additional complaint that I seek to file.

My wife (Deepshikha Kalra, in CC) received an inquiry(copy attached) from you related to case E-38585. She is sick, so I am trying to answer it to the best of my knowledge (and I prefer email for all communication).
1. Response to your case file E-38585 was dispatched by my wife on Jan-07-2020. The returned confirmation receipt and tracking number shows that it was received by your office on Jan-08-2020.
2. A copy of the response she sent on Jan-07-2020 is also attached anyways. In case you have not received the mail yet then this email must do the needful.
At this point, I want to highlight to you that this act by Mr. Darwin Marchell, P.E. and Alan Green is "act of retaliation" against me and my family just discovered through questions that they and many in cedar park engineering department are putting "business calculations" in place of "safety/engineering calculations" to do civil work from last 20 YEARS (email confirmation from them regarding it can be sent to you and to others in TBPE for reading). They even do not do comparative study.
Not only that, the city has not taken any permits for making road next to BCCP (confirmed via Travis County open records), not left mandatory 30 feet distance from BCCP, have not done any pollution and noise checks, and now its compliance department isn't even registering the complaint (Against city for noise, safety and smoke violations) to check against the city's own rules and regulations that they want others to comply.

     We did raised the concern to TBPE by reporting it and asking for inquiry in Jan-2019, and then Feb-2019 and then Nov-2019. All these were surprisingly not even considered.
To me, it seems like a joke or a serious *under-developed country* style corruption. Everyone is saving each other.

Mr. Darwin Marchell, P.E. has shared the following link about specificaOons on Aug-01-2018.
hip://www.dot.state.tx.us/apps-cg/specs/SearchForm.asp?type=7
I am pasOng an excerpt from the spec on this link:
"Design Calculations. Include calculations covering the range of heights and loading conditions on the project.
Calculations for both internal and external stability as described on the plans will be required. Include a summary of all
design parameters used; material types, strength values, and assumed allowable; loads and loading combinations; and factor-
of-safety parameters."
AND, at the same Ome, I have this email(attached as PDF, because of the email history) where Mr. Darwin who is represenOng the city engineers is trying to tell me that calculaOons are business-calculaOons and that is how the city has operated from last 20+ years.
Mr. Sam Roberts, P.E. has come forward to clarify my doubts about the noise and polluOon that the structure is now producing was never a responsibility of the city even when written concerns were given to them before the work started, and I may need some assistance from TBPE to cross-examine the facts as and when they are presented to me in the meeOng.
I am hoping that TBPE will accept the request for joining the meeOng.
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

Thanks for the clarificaOon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?
ArOcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or aiached to the motor vehicle.
o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Ores on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaOons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
I am not a legal expert and I will try geÄng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.
I am available mostly on Fridays aper 2:00 PM. I will only come if the session is fully recorded (Audio and Video) that I will also get access to it, and will like to know the parOcipant's name 2 days before hand.

Dear Mr. Kalra. The purpose of this communicaOon to you is to try to answer some of the quesOons and concerns in your last 2 emails (below) and to provide some informaOon that you may or may not be aware of. Below is a bullet summary of this informaOon I wish to convey to you:
· First of all I need to inform you that Chris Copple, Robert, Kevin and Amber do not enforce the city’s Noise RegulaOons, ArOcle 8.08. The Noise RegulaOons are enforced by the Cedar Park Police Department.
o If you wish to report a noise complaint (excluding noise from vehicles in the public right-of-way, see below) call 911 or call the Police Department’s main number 512-260- 4600.
· Secondly, I need to tell you that the City’s Noise RegulaOons, specifically, ArOcle 8.008.005 (3) grant an exempOon to sounds produced by motor vehicles in the public right-of-way (e.g. Anderson Mill Rd). See verbiage from the city’s ordinance below:
        ArOcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while

  the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound producing equipment within the motor vehicle or aiached to the motor vehicle.
o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Ores on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaOons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
· And Lastly, regarding your complaint about the air contaminants coming from Anderson Mill Rd onto your property exceeding the City’s Environmental Standards Ordinance ArOcle 8.12, I need to inform you that these regulaOons apply to air contaminants generated by uses within properOes or “zoning districts” around the City and the thresholds are measured at the property boundary. These regulaOons do not apply to public roadways, except during the construcOon of such public roadways.
In closing, I would like to offer to meet with you to try to answer any quesOons you may have. I will need to include some of the subject maier experts such as the engineers who worked on the roadway in such a meeOng. If you would like to meet, please let me know of some dates and Omes you are available. And please also feel free to call me at the number below.

  Mr. Robert, Mr. Kevin, Ms. Amber:
This is my 2nd reminder email to take action on my complaint of non-compliance by the city by building structure next to my property. The city is not compliant to :
§ 8.08 noise regulation not met on my property.
§ 8.12 pollution and smoke due to structure on my property.
Please give me a complaint-ID or tracking number or simple email reply in writing to confirm that you are or will be investigating this issue.
If there is 'No action' on your part, and not even registering the case, then I will go to TCOLE for help.

     The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.
There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).
Ref : Table 3 of book, and AASHTO std is already with you to guide.

I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this.
Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below
Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies
   Page 554 of 636

     that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that
 Page 555 of 636

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:29:49 Central Standard Time
 are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this. Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in
            Page 559 of 636

  documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this
construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below
Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are
                Page 561 of 636

      those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then
 Page 562 of 636

that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then
      please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.
There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).

= = = = = =
I have been to the ‘Anderson mill road phase-1 expansion’ meeting once when the city of cedar park invited me and other residents to tell their concerns. I was hopeful on that day and wrote concern.pdf where I have clearly laid down concerns that I thought to cover at least what I was foreseeing. I am not that hopeful today.
They say: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
I am no more than the “fool” they said in that proverb. I still came here because the cost of not doing this meeting is direr than accepting ‘fool’. It may be activism inside me that is telling me to voice my concerns for not just my family, but for others, and for the animals and wildlife which otherwise cannot say or tell anything.
When I was pulled for the first time, it was because the expansion would directly impact me and It did. From the last 1+ yrs I have lost sleep, peace of mind, and more so, have lost health. But this is not the end of it.
When I looked further, and thorough investigation of my own, I found that all of it could have been saved if the city paid some attention to feedback it got from the first meeting, and things can still turn around if I can wake-up someone from the city to take steps.
Over the last 1+ year, I have seen gross negligence on part of not just city engineers, but almost everyone (including city-management, the mayor and his council) and my purpose of meeting with you-all again is to remind you-all about the duty you have towards the city.
[ CITY ENGINEERS ]
The city-engineers have not done any safety calculations for this project even when their own documents suggest that it as a mandatory step, and even after I raised red-flag that doing this is basically paving the road on a null-drawing. All I got in return were arguments that were mere speculation, and not facts and stats. I am now increasingly becoming skeptical that they have ever done it for any public work throughout their career with this city.
Why is the JD (Job Description) of a city engineer? Does the city really need such engineers? and How they are better than any ‘plumber’ who could have executed the project by reading drawings and asking workers to pave the road.
 Page 573 of 636

 [ CITY MANAGEMENT ]
The city has made the road that is proving hazardous to me and the vegetation on my property. This road is next to the BCCP property. Through an earlier study done by the city, The city was already aware of wildlife and endangered species in the BCCP area, yet they felt that there is no need to take the permits from BCCP or from US fish and wildlife services.
The road is currently paved 1 foot away from BCCP land when AASHTO standards suggest 30 feet distance in a high traffic zone. Just to let you know: I and others have started seeing the effect of this road on wildlife. The deers, birds, and wildlife that I and other residents used to see have gone down drastically.
I will not be surprised if in the next 10 yrs or so some land mafia may propose to buy this land on the argument that now all the endangered species are extinct, so let's make a multiplex and grocery mart instead, and the city will gladly give them tax break and other goodies in the name of development.
[ WORK ETHICS of OFFICIALS ]
What is the meaning of the word ‘public’ in ‘public sector jobs’ and what is your charter for work-ethics?
I have worked with many elementary schools( as a volunteer) for an extended period of time (6 yrs or so). When you visit any school in the USA, the teachers and volunteers are trained to look for potential problems and report immediately even when it is not really a problem because not reporting can be more painful when real lives matter.
The engineers in this city do want to understand what I am saying. They are essentially corrupt in their minds and are simply supporting each other because that is how they can survive in such situations. Maybe all are part of this.
The mayor and other officials are ready to take up hours and hours of email complaints from me, but will never question the other staff members' work. Officials here (if they can’t act on it themselves) would not even report it further even when the lives of residents, wildlife and travelers may be at risk. To me, the elementary school teachers and volunteers are doing a better job of holding work ethics than officials here.
Ask yourself: Did your duty to ‘public’ genuinely solve problems for the public or is it just a feeding ground for land-mafias?
In the name of development, the city has cheated with lives in my family, with other residents who are not a fool-enough like me to report it (or they got tired), with the disabled wildlife who cannot represent themselves, and with every student, joggers, and other pedestrian for years to come.
  You may call this city - cedar park, but to me, it is 'cheaters park'.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own
     Page 576 of 636

  compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
Acoustic Beamforming: Mapping Sources of Truck Noise , link: https://books.google.com/books? id=rDyhc7WhqqIC&pg=PA7&dq=argument+motor+vehicle+motor+sound+is+not+motor+vehicle+tyre+sound& hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2uMbW9evmAhUZCs0KHZ9cCjQQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v =onepage&q=argument%20motor%20vehicle%20motor%20sound%20is%20not%20motor%20vehicle%20tyr e%20sound&f=false

I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.
There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).
Ref : Table 3 of book, and AASHTO std is already with you to guide.

                  Page 577 of 636

   even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
                  Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to
 the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the
Page 579 of 636

       the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
 Page 580 of 636

       Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is
in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.

I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.

I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.
There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).

I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this. Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

                    Page 593 of 636

        Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
 Page 594 of 636

        pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is
in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct- 30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
 Page 595 of 636

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:29:58 Central Standard Time
          Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments).

There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).

I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this. Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

     All:
I will be marking few Local news media in CC now onwards (they are now in CC). Some international news media has also expressed interest in covering the news but I will only go to them if the City continue to not follow their own ordinances and do not take enough actions even after the writing them for years.

Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below
Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide
   Page 607 of 636

      me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years). Were there any meeting records, emails to show that
there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
 Page 608 of 636

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:30:00 Central Standard Time
        Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city?
                  Page 619 of 636

     What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then
 Page 620 of 636

that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then
     --
please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

Dear Robert, Kevin and Amber.
You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
Acoustic Beamforming: Mapping Sources of Truck Noise , link: https://books.google.com/books? id=rDyhc7WhqqIC&pg=PA7&dq=argument+motor+vehicle+motor+sound+is+not+motor+vehicle+tyre+sound&hl=e n&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2uMbW9evmAhUZCs0KHZ9cCjQQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=onepag e&q=argument%20motor%20vehicle%20motor%20sound%20is%20not%20motor%20vehicle%20tyre%20sound&f =false

I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.
There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).
Ref : Table 3 of book, and AASHTO std is already with you to guide.

I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this.
Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Hi, I live on 201 Gaspar Bend cedar Park tx.
The city of Cedar Park TX expanded the road next to my house (it is on BCCP corridor), and I would like to get the copy of contract and permit to review their construction of expansion of
Anderson Mill road that they did starting May-2017 and ended Aug-2018. I am marking Cedar Park TX official in CC for them to officially know of this request as well.
Before you read below: Please reply all and try to keep all in loop.
Under BCCP, there must be no major construction (major = beyond 3000 sq ft) without permit (ref: Table3 of book mentioned below). Also, any construction should have maintained at least 30 feet of distance from BCCP boundary in an urban settings. I see City of Cedar Park violating all rules when they worked on the expansion project. They have left less than 1 feet distance right now between road and BCCP boundary and also messed up many things related to safety and noise prevention and many more compliances laid down by them.
In my understanding there is some relaxation to the distance rule only if the count of vehicles passing is less than 750 or else AASHTO road standards says so. I have reviewed on my end and AASHTO does not reduce the distance to mere 1 feet and the vehicle count is way way more than 750 every day. This road is now a highway and with no safety.
Given the speed at which vehicles pass day and night and the count (Well above 750 per day for sure), and the loud noise the road is producing (at nuisance level if measured) I think very soon they will destroy the habitat.

    Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people

and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.
