The first things project planners do is decide if their project will occur within the range of a listed species. If so, they need to decide if their project may affect listed species or its habitat. If they do not decide that their project may affect a listed species, they are not required to provide any informaOon to us, so their assessment is largely up to their own professional judgement. Usually with the listed golden-cheeked warbler, they look to see if the project will necessitate clearing any trees that could serve as potenOal nesOng habitat. If the project is planned within an area that is already developed with roads and commercial or residenOal buildings and/or will not involve clearing addiOonal trees, there is a very small likelihood that their project would impact the warbler, so they probably wouldn't involve us. If they thought their project would result in an impact to the species, they would come to us for guidance at that point.

Thanks for confirmation.
What are few of the things a city "should" or "must" have done to conclude that their work does not have any impacts on federally listed species.
For e.g. [1] They may have done some geological survey around these habitats and species, [2] consulted with professors in some universities (Texas University, TAMU, Dallas University,..)
         Page 1 of 141

  and more importantly how long back can these researchers go? (can they say that they surveyed 10 or 20 years ago and concluded this?)
At one point they told me that the layout of the road and its expansion was in 1950's planning, and geological surveys on impact of wildlife were done 15 yrs back.

   Hi Paige,
This is FYI: I just got a reply from a BCCP official where she does not see any wrongdoings by the city. I am not sure if FWS and BCCP are the same or different in their standing as the BCCP official still asked me to check FSW..

I understand your concerns and I remember providing some informaOon to Travis County in response to your inquiries about this in January 2020.
To be clear, neither Travis County nor the City of AusOn BCCP programs have anything to do with the widening of Anderson Mill near your home. This was a City of Cedar Park project. City of Cedar Park projects are not eligible to parOcipate in the BCCP Permit for their Endangered Species Act habitat miOgaOon requirements. The BCCP can only provide habitat miOgaOon for eligible projects in Travis County and not in Williamson County.
The City of Cedar Park did coordinate throughout this project with the City of AusOn BCP faciliOes staff to make sure any fence damages during construcOon were taken care of and everything was repaired to our saOsfacOon. I went out to the site yesterday to inspect for any damages to the BCP property and didn’t see any. This project was completed a couple years ago and the adjacent BCP property has not been negaOvely impacted by it. This project has actually resulted in less damage to the preserve and habitat. As I understand it, the widening of Anderson Mill was, in part, a safety improvement project to smooth out some of the more dangerous curves in the road. Before the compleOon of this road widening project, there were many automobile collisions into our BCP fence which resulted in some habitat disturbance during repairs. Since this project was completed, there have not been any automobile/fence collisions on our BCP property.
In summary, the widening of this roadway did not violate the terms of the Balcones Canyonlands ConservaOon Plan and there has been no noOceable negaOve impacts to the adjacent Balcones Canyonlands Preserve. I do not believe there is anything the County or the City can do for you in this situaOon, and I don’t believe we have any addiOonal informaOon to supply regarding this completed Anderson Mill Road widening project by the City of Cedar Park.
If you are trying to figure out if this roadway improvement project was completed in compliance with the Federal Endangered Species Act, you may want to consider reaching out to the local US Fish and Wildlife AusOn Ecological Services office.

    The reason for writing this email was to bring to your knowledge that I have been tracking the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd (that the city of Cedar Park) did was next to BCCP land. They did *NOT* took any permissions with BCCP to construct the road. The road is now 0 cm away from the BCCP. The expansion has also impacted my property too. I have used the BCCP tools that you have given to highlight my property. The road that runs between my property and BCCP Land had ~25 ft distance on both sides, but now it is 0 with BCCP and that too without US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b). They also pushed the road next to my property and now it sits with just a 10 ft walkway in between.
When I inquired to City, the engineers told me(verbally) that as the land on either side of the road belongs to the city they are free to do whatever without any permits.
I am looking for a legal answer to the following question in light of this information:
Is such major expansion without permits allowed if the other party owns land next to BCCP. Or is there a special get-away for City officials to do so?
Have the city engineers done the changes to structure within their allowed limits when expanding the road?
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX. I have also sent pictures of expansion and 0 distance between the road and BCCP land earlier to the official BCCP Email but have not gotten any reply.
I have also seen significantly fewer incidents of spotting wildlife and birds in and around my property which may be a result of this construction.
    Page 6 of 141

    So to contrast what is there in actuality and what is on the BCCP site, I am sending screen shorts and links to google earth. The BCCP image shows that there is a clearance between land and road, and google earth shows 0 distance.

     Thank you for inquiring about what steps you might need to develop your site. Our program works with landowners and developers to help with Endangered Species Act compliance in western Travis County through an expedited applicaOon and cerOficate process under the BCCP.
The best way to do this is to submit an applicaOon to our program: hops://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/Docs/applicaOon.pdf. You can email me for guidance in filling out the applicaOon if you need to. The applicaOon is simple and the main piece of informaOon that I need is the tax parcel ID; or survey, if it has recently been subdivided.
With informaOon you provide, we use TCAD parcel informaOon and the parOcipaOon zone maps to provide a response back to you with the following: a habitat determinaOon map, any condiOons that may apply if you choose to parOcipate, a quote for miOgaOon costs, and/or next steps and opOons. You can check what habitat fee zones are within your project area using our webmap: hops://arcg.is/0Pqbjb [arcg.is] To use the webmap, search your property using your address or TCAD ID. This map is best viewed on a Desktop computer. Or, if you prefer, you can check on the staOc maps showing habitat zones here: hops://www.traviscountytx.gov/maps. We also use the TCAD parcel informaOon to check to be sure that your site has not already been miOgated or paid for, through our process or a separate US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 10(a) permit. The applicaOon and our response do not commit you to any acOon – this is a service we provide to help inform your opOons. This part of the process – from receipt of your applicaOon to our response – typically takes 15 or fewer days. More informaOon on the process can be found on our website.
Ater you receive our response leoer, we encourage you to review the opOons and email us for any quesOons. If you can parOcipate through our process (only a few sites cannot), you can noOfy us if you are ready to pay the miOgaOon and we will prepare and send a contract for you to sign; you will sign and return with your payment; we will issue the ParOcipaOon CerOficate to you and record with the County Clerk. The cerOficate goes with the property, not the person; so, if you sell the site in the future, the new landowner is covered for development within the same parcel.
You do not have to parOcipate with us – you may apply for an ESA 10(a)(1)(B) permit through the local USFWS office by contacOng Paige Najvar at, (512) 490-0057 extension 229, or paige_najvar@fws.gov. Obtaining a USFWS permit can be a lengthy process and entails developing a Habitat ConservaOon Plan including mulOple year species surveys, a miOgaOon proposal, going through a public involvement process, and meeOng all the permit issuance criteria.
Thanks for contacOng Travis County for informaOon. Please feel free to call me if you have any quesOons. I look forward to helping you find an answer to fit your needs.

BCCP documents talk of "permits" to create and develop a structure that is more than 3000 sqft (Major structure is coined in BCCP documents as 3000 sq. ft) near or inside BCCP land. These are covered under - US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b)
Q(1)
If a Builder, a city, or person has land next** to BCCP, do they need permission to construct Major construction such as DAM, ROAD, Ecommerce Warehouses, etc?
Note**: The land, in this case, does not belong to BCCP but is directly attached to BCCP land i.e. distance between them is 0 ft. away from BCCP.
Q(2)
If the participation contract is NOT signed and a BCCP permit (sometimes referred to as BCCP Participation Certificate) is NOT issued, then what is the legal action that BCCP Oaths to take?

I worked with BCCP to see if there were any wrongdoings and they found nothing, so I will be submitting my request in the coming few days.
But before I do so, I will like to clarify why I was investigating engineers' wrongdoing w.r.t BCCP too.
Wildlife has no representation other than us. The City and Engineers decided to construct a major artery road next to wildlife here. All of us know that a drunk driver has an equal chance of entering with a 18 wheeler into wildlife, and noise+pollution will drastically affect wildlife too. A notice or permit may have forced BCCP, Lawmakers and City Engineers to study the situation and maybe look for mitigating some problems we will soon see in the next few decades. That never happened. Now BCCP officials are okay to overlook this (probably they cannot do much, similar to TBPE that cannot act on city engineers).
We combined our responsibilities for the preservation of the wildlife and somehow everyone has neglected it to the extent that they can.
Do you know what will happen just outside this BCCP land in the next 2 to 3 years. The land at 1431 and Anderson-mill road intersection is sold to HEB and AMAZON to make huge mega warehouses. Trucks will run 7x24. AMAZON has already started rolling out things that will make them the savior of wildlife.
https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22686696/jeff-bezos-amazon-billionaires-biodiversity-conservation? campaign_id=0&emc=edit_cr_20210929&instance_id=0&nl=comments- notifications&regi_id=154276465&segment_id=0&user_id=6cc7db1a85510cad9cfd2f40c7bcbcc1
I may leave this place in the next 2 or 3 years, but the road will not leave. It will sit and kill because of lack of safety, but also because of generated noise and pollution.

Regarding your two quesOons – we are not asking that one prove a negaOve. However, we do understand that a crux of your issue is that a study was not done (absence of a report) and you believe there should have been one. In that case, it would be important for us to understand where the requirement is (if you know) that states a study was required. Is there a city ordinance, or TXDOT requirement, etc. If this is a best-pracOce situaOon rather than a code or ordinance requirement, then that informaOon would be helpful as well.
As for safety issues – No, of course we do not want anything dangerous to happen to anyone and a fatality is absolutely not required for an issue to be reviewed. If you wish to send in informaOon from your wife, that is fine if it as a personal opinion (vs a sealed report) as she is not a PE in Texas and we don’t want to run into sealing / rule issues. Support from specific codes, etc. is helpful . Also any other engineering analyses or info you might have would be helpful.
You noted the BCCP requirements. Is this for the roadway or power poles, etc? It would be helpful to understand this piece as well. Is the contenOon basically that the city was required to do a BCCP permit for the road itself?
One final comment – since a complaint is against a specific engineer, please provide your informaOon in the context of what that engineer did or was responsible for. For example, if a design error was made, point out how you think that engineer was related to the error. If a study was not done, how was the engineer responsible, etc. This will help with specifying potenOal violaOons.

Dear Mr. Lance.
Thanks for the email and I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs
I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following:
1. You said - "Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an "absence of necessary safety calculaOons" to produce a safe design?
        Page 14 of 141

  Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not pracOce the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculaOons?
a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculaOons done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a leoer to support that without calculaOons the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 t spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?
2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that s/he did consider these at the "design" phase to cater to need of the FEDERAL agency here. What shall I be asking them to produce?
I am attaching specific slides from BCCP presentation

As we have previously discussed, we can provide some guidance on filing a complaint and what is needed and helpful to have a complaint move forward. I’d be happy to assist.
   Page 16 of 141

   A couple of things to note at the start – I cannot file the complaint for you; you’ll need to complete the appropriate form and submit any evidence you have. Also, by providing this guidance it does not mean that we are for or against any party in a complaint, nor does it infer that we will find in favor or against any parOcular person or enOty as part of a case. We can open a case per our laws and rules and we will processes it to its appropriate conclusion.
That being said, you noted that you wish to proceed with a complaint against the design engineer. For any complaint, we need to meet a few parOcular thresholds: a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potenOal violaOons should be as specific as possible; the potenOal violaOons must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering; and there must be supporOng evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdicOon to invesOgate or take acOon and if there is a potenOal violaOon to more forward with.
To go through these a bit more:
Rule or Law violaOons: please list the rules you think this individual may have violated. You don’t need to be an aoorney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direcOon on why you think this person did something wrong. In addiOon, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specificaOon, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules – please note that. For example, if you think a person did not follow a naOonal design specificaOon or guidance, please let us know which one(s). For contrast: only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direcOon for an invesOgaOon and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated secOon XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of AusOn’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
The rule or law violaOons should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad. For example, a design plan that has errors that you can idenOfy and is signed by a specific PE may be a violaOon, but a general accusaOon that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that informaOon.
A violaOon must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering. This determines if the board has jurisdicOon to pursue the complaint. A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal acOon and should be handled by the police. On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their pracOce of professional engineering.
The last piece is evidence: if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can. If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that. If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well. Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an invesOgaOon because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court). In addiOon to this, TBPELS does not go on ‘fishing expediOons’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or enOty and then search for potenOal violaOons. We need somewhere specific to focus. That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.
If we get this kind of informaOon, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdicOon to move forward, and then conOnue with an invesOgaOon.

I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re- set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates
       Page 20 of 141

     TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submioed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maoers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beoer equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things.
 Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or
Page 21 of 141

     Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.
Sincerely,

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
        There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any
 Page 24 of 141

       request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2. Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maoer with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons. Michael Sims, P.E.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the
           Page 40 of 141

                    right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÅng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Dear Mr. Lance, Mr. Sims, and City Officials:
A very timely article to share to you and city: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58740362
It is not far when you may see a similar article listing some wildlife from BCCP/FWS land.

I worked with BCCP to see if there were any wrongdoings and they found nothing, so I will be submitting my request in the coming few days.
But before I do so, I will like to clarify why I was investigating engineers' wrongdoing w.r.t BCCP too.
Wildlife has no representation other than us. The City and Engineers decided to construct a major artery road next to wildlife here. All of us know that a drunk driver has an equal chance of entering with a 18 wheeler into wildlife, and noise+pollution will drastically affect wildlife too. A notice or permit may have forced BCCP, Lawmakers and City Engineers to study the situation and maybe look for mitigating some problems we will soon see in the next few decades. That never happened. Now BCCP officials are okay to overlook this (probably they cannot do much, similar to TBPE that cannot act on city engineers).
We combined our responsibilities for the preservation of the wildlife and somehow everyone has neglected it to the extent that they can.
Do you know what will happen just outside this BCCP land in the next 2 to 3 years. The land at 1431 and Anderson-mill road intersection is sold to HEB and AMAZON to make huge mega warehouses. Trucks will run 7x24. AMAZON has already started rolling out things that will make them the savior of wildlife.

I may leave this place in the next 2 or 3 years, but the road will not leave. It will sit and kill because of lack of safety, but also because of generated noise and pollution.

Regarding your two quesOons – we are not asking that one prove a negaOve. However, we do understand that a crux of your issue is that a study was not done (absence of a report) and you believe there should have been one. In that case, it would be important for us to understand where the requirement is (if you know) that states a study was required. Is there a city ordinance, or TXDOT requirement, etc. If this is a best-pracOce situaOon rather than a code or ordinance requirement, then that informaOon would be helpful as well.
As for safety issues – No, of course we do not want anything dangerous to happen to anyone and a fatality is absolutely not required for an issue to be reviewed. If you wish to send in informaOon from your wife, that is fine if it as a personal opinion (vs a sealed report) as she is not a PE in Texas and we don’t want to run into sealing / rule issues. Support from specific codes, etc. is helpful . Also any other engineering analyses or info you might have would be helpful.
You noted the BCCP requirements. Is this for the roadway or power poles, etc? It would be helpful to understand this piece as well. Is the contenOon basically that the city was required to do a BCCP permit for the road itself?
One final comment – since a complaint is against a specific engineer, please provide your informaOon in the context of what that engineer did or was responsible for. For example, if a design error was made, point out how you think that engineer was related to the error. If a study was not done, how was the engineer responsible, etc. This will help with specifying potenOal violaOons.
I appreciate your assistance in these maoers. Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Lance.
Thanks for the email and I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs
I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following:
1. You said - "Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an "absence of necessary safety calculaOons" to produce a safe design?
        Page 46 of 141

  Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not pracOce the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculaOons?
a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculaOons done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a leoer to support that without calculaOons the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 t spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?
2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that s/he did consider these at the "design" phase to cater to need of the FEDERAL agency here. What shall I be asking them to produce?
I am attaching specific slides from BCCP presentation

As we have previously discussed, we can provide some guidance on filing a complaint and what is needed and helpful to have a complaint move forward. I’d be happy to assist.
   Page 48 of 141

   A couple of things to note at the start – I cannot file the complaint for you; you’ll need to complete the appropriate form and submit any evidence you have. Also, by providing this guidance it does not mean that we are for or against any party in a complaint, nor does it infer that we will find in favor or against any parOcular person or enOty as part of a case. We can open a case per our laws and rules and we will processes it to its appropriate conclusion.
That being said, you noted that you wish to proceed with a complaint against the design engineer. For any complaint, we need to meet a few parOcular thresholds: a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potenOal violaOons should be as specific as possible; the potenOal violaOons must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering; and there must be supporOng evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdicOon to invesOgate or take acOon and if there is a potenOal violaOon to more forward with.
To go through these a bit more:
Rule or Law violaOons: please list the rules you think this individual may have violated. You don’t need to be an aoorney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direcOon on why you think this person did something wrong. In addiOon, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specificaOon, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules – please note that. For example, if you think a person did not follow a naOonal design specificaOon or guidance, please let us know which one(s). For contrast: only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direcOon for an invesOgaOon and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated secOon XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of AusOn’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
The rule or law violaOons should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad. For example, a design plan that has errors that you can idenOfy and is signed by a specific PE may be a violaOon, but a general accusaOon that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that informaOon.
A violaOon must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering. This determines if the board has jurisdicOon to pursue the complaint. A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal acOon and should be handled by the police. On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their pracOce of professional engineering.
The last piece is evidence: if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can. If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that. If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well. Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an invesOgaOon because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court). In addiOon to this, TBPELS does not go on ‘fishing expediOons’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or enOty and then search for potenOal violaOons. We need somewhere specific to focus. That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.
If we get this kind of informaOon, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdicOon to move forward, and then conOnue with an invesOgaOon.

On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good aternoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re- set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates
       Page 52 of 141

     TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submioed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are maoers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are beoer equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things.
 Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or

The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.
Sincerely,

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
        There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any
 Page 56 of 141

       request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2. Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this maoer with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons. Michael Sims, P.E.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

           Page 72 of 141

                    right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot siÅng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ t distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it

hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 t siÅng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

The first things project planners do is decide if their project will occur within the range of a listed species. If so, they need to decide if their project may affect listed species or its habitat. If they do not decide that their project may affect a listed species, they are not required to provide any informaOon to us, so their assessment is largely up to their own professional judgement. Usually with the listed golden-cheeked warbler, they look to see if the project will necessitate clearing any trees that could serve as potenOal nesOng habitat. If the project is planned within an area that is already developed with roads and commercial or residenOal buildings and/or will not involve clearing addiOonal trees, there is a very small likelihood that their project would impact the warbler, so they probably wouldn't involve us. If they thought their project would result in an impact to the species, they would come to us for guidance at that point.

What are few of the things a city "should" or "must" have done to conclude that their work does not have any impacts on federally listed species.
For e.g. [1] They may have done some geological survey around these habitats and species, [2]

At one point they told me that the layout of the road and its expansion was in 1950's planning, and geological surveys on impact of wildlife were done 15 yrs back.

I understand your concerns and I remember providing some informaOon to Travis County in response to your inquiries about this in January 2020.
To be clear, neither Travis County nor the City of AusOn BCCP programs have anything to do with the widening of Anderson Mill near your home. This was a City of Cedar Park project. City of Cedar Park projects are not eligible to parOcipate in the BCCP Permit for their Endangered Species Act habitat miOgaOon requirements. The BCCP can only provide habitat miOgaOon for eligible projects in Travis County and not in Williamson County.
The City of Cedar Park did coordinate throughout this project with the City of AusOn BCP faciliOes staff to make sure any fence damages during construcOon were taken care of and everything was repaired to our saOsfacOon. I went out to the site yesterday to inspect for any damages to the BCP property and didn’t see any. This project was completed a couple years ago and the adjacent BCP property has not been negaOvely impacted by it. This project has actually resulted in less damage to the preserve and habitat. As I understand it, the widening of Anderson Mill was, in part, a safety improvement project to smooth out some of the more dangerous curves in the road. Before the compleOon of this road widening project, there were many automobile collisions into our BCP fence which resulted in some habitat disturbance during repairs. Since this project was completed, there have not been any automobile/fence collisions on our BCP property.
In summary, the widening of this roadway did not violate the terms of the Balcones Canyonlands ConservaOon Plan and there has been no noOceable negaOve impacts to the adjacent Balcones Canyonlands Preserve. I do not believe there is anything the County or the City can do for you in this situaOon, and I don’t believe we have any addiOonal informaOon to supply regarding this completed Anderson Mill Road widening project by the City of Cedar Park.
If you are trying to figure out if this roadway improvement project was completed in compliance with the Federal Endangered Species Act, you may want to consider reaching out to the local US Fish and Wildlife AusOn Ecological Services office.

    The reason for writing this email was to bring to your knowledge that I have been tracking the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd (that the city of Cedar Park) did was next to BCCP land. They did *NOT* took any permissions with BCCP to construct the road. The road is now 0 cm away from the BCCP. The expansion has also impacted my property too. I have used the BCCP tools that you have given to highlight my property. The road that runs between my property and BCCP Land had ~25 ft distance on both sides, but now it is 0 with BCCP and that too without US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b). They also pushed the road next to my property and now it sits with just a 10 ft walkway in between.
When I inquired to City, the engineers told me(verbally) that as the land on either side of the road belongs to the city they are free to do whatever without any permits.
I am looking for a legal answer to the following question in light of this information:
Is such major expansion without permits allowed if the other party owns land next to BCCP. Or is there a special get-away for City officials to do so?
Have the city engineers done the changes to structure within their allowed limits when expanding the road?
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX. I have also sent pictures of expansion and 0 distance between the road and BCCP land earlier to the official BCCP Email but have not gotten any reply.
I have also seen significantly fewer incidents of spotting wildlife and birds in and around my property which may be a result of this construction.
    Page 80 of 141

    So to contrast what is there in actuality and what is on the BCCP site, I am sending screen shorts and links to google earth. The BCCP image shows that there is a clearance between land and road, and google earth shows 0 distance.

     Thank you for inquiring about what steps you might need to develop your site. Our program works with landowners and developers to help with Endangered Species Act compliance in western Travis County through an expedited applicaOon and cerOficate process under the BCCP.
The best way to do this is to submit an applicaOon to our program: hops://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/Docs/applicaOon.pdf. You can email me for guidance in filling out the applicaOon if you need to. The applicaOon is simple and the main piece of informaOon that I need is the tax parcel ID; or survey, if it has recently been subdivided.
With informaOon you provide, we use TCAD parcel informaOon and the parOcipaOon zone maps to provide a response back to you with the following: a habitat determinaOon map, any condiOons that may apply if you choose to parOcipate, a quote for miOgaOon costs, and/or next steps and opOons. You can check what habitat fee zones are within your project area using our webmap: hops://arcg.is/0Pqbjb [arcg.is] To use the webmap, search your property using your address or TCAD ID. This map is best viewed on a Desktop computer. Or, if you prefer, you can check on the staOc maps showing habitat zones here: hops://www.traviscountytx.gov/maps. We also use the TCAD parcel informaOon to check to be sure that your site has not already been miOgated or paid for, through our process or a separate US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 10(a) permit. The applicaOon and our response do not commit you to any acOon – this is a service we provide to help inform your opOons. This part of the process – from receipt of your applicaOon to our response – typically takes 15 or fewer days. More informaOon on the process can be found on our website.
Ater you receive our response leoer, we encourage you to review the opOons and email us for any quesOons. If you can parOcipate through our process (only a few sites cannot), you can noOfy us if you are ready to pay the miOgaOon and we will prepare and send a contract for you to sign; you will sign and return with your payment; we will issue the ParOcipaOon CerOficate to you and record with the County Clerk. The cerOficate goes with the property, not the person; so, if you sell the site in the future, the new landowner is covered for development within the same parcel.
You do not have to parOcipate with us – you may apply for an ESA 10(a)(1)(B) permit through the local USFWS office by contacOng Paige Najvar at, (512) 490-0057 extension 229, or paige_najvar@fws.gov. Obtaining a USFWS permit can be a lengthy process and entails developing a Habitat ConservaOon Plan including mulOple year species surveys, a miOgaOon proposal, going through a public involvement process, and meeOng all the permit issuance criteria.
Thanks for contacOng Travis County for informaOon. Please feel free to call me if you have any quesOons. I look forward to helping you find an answer to fit your needs.

Hi,
BCCP documents talk of "permits" to create and develop a structure that is more than 3000 sqft (Major structure is coined in BCCP documents as 3000 sq. ft) near or inside BCCP land. These are covered under - US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b)
Q(1)
If a Builder, a city, or person has land next** to BCCP, do they need permission to construct Major construction such as DAM, ROAD, Ecommerce Warehouses, etc?
Note**: The land, in this case, does not belong to BCCP but is directly attached to BCCP land i.e. distance between them is 0 ft. away from BCCP.
Q(2)
If the participation contract is NOT signed and a BCCP permit (sometimes referred to as BCCP Participation Certificate) is NOT issued, then what is the legal action that BCCP Oaths to take? Is there a section of the law that can be referred or can I be connected with a legal attorney overlooking BCCP legal in this regard?

With informaOon you provide, we use TCAD parcel informaOon and the parOcipaOon zone maps to provide a response back to you with the following: a habitat determinaOon map, any condiOons that may apply if you choose to parOcipate, a quote for miOgaOon costs, and/or next steps and opOons. You can check what habitat fee zones are within your project area using our webmap: hops://arcg.is/0Pqbjb [arcg.is] To use the webmap, search your property using your address or TCAD ID. This map is best viewed on a Desktop computer. Or, if you prefer, you can check on the staOc maps showing habitat zones here: hops://www.traviscountytx.gov/maps. We also use the TCAD parcel informaOon to check to be sure that your site has not already been miOgated or paid for, through our process or a separate US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 10(a) permit. The applicaOon and our response do not commit you to any acOon – this is a service we provide to help inform your opOons. This part of the process – from receipt of your applicaOon to our response – typically takes 15 or fewer days. More informaOon on the process can be found on our website.
Ater you receive our response leoer, we encourage you to review the opOons and email us for any quesOons. If you can parOcipate through our process (only a few sites cannot), you can noOfy us if you are ready to pay the miOgaOon and we will prepare and send a contract for you to sign; you will sign and return with your payment; we will issue the ParOcipaOon CerOficate to you and record with the County Clerk. The cerOficate goes with the property, not the person; so, if you sell the site in the future, the new landowner is covered for development within the same parcel.
You do not have to parOcipate with us – you may apply for an ESA 10(a)(1)(B) permit through the local USFWS office by contacOng Paige Najvar at, (512) 490-0057 extension 229, or paige_najvar@fws.gov. Obtaining a USFWS permit can be a lengthy process and entails developing a Habitat ConservaOon Plan including mulOple year species surveys, a miOgaOon proposal, going through a public involvement process, and meeOng all the permit issuance criteria.
Thanks for contacOng Travis County for informaOon. Please feel free to call me if you have any quesOons. I look forward to helping you find an answer to fit your needs.

Hi Paige,
This is FYI: I just got a reply from a BCCP official where she does not see any wrongdoings by the city. I am not sure if FWS and BCCP are the same or different in their standing as the BCCP official still asked me to check FSW..

I understand your concerns and I remember providing some informaOon to Travis County in response to your inquiries about this in January 2020.
To be clear, neither Travis County nor the City of AusOn BCCP programs have anything to do with the widening of Anderson Mill near your home. This was a City of Cedar Park project. City of Cedar Park projects are not eligible to parOcipate in the BCCP Permit for their Endangered Species Act habitat miOgaOon requirements. The BCCP can only provide habitat miOgaOon for eligible projects in Travis County and not in Williamson County.
The City of Cedar Park did coordinate throughout this project with the City of AusOn BCP faciliOes staff to make sure any fence damages during construcOon were taken care of and everything was repaired to our saOsfacOon. I went out to the site yesterday to inspect for any damages to the BCP property and didn’t see any. This project was completed a couple years ago and the adjacent BCP property has not been negaOvely impacted by it. This project has actually resulted in less damage to the preserve and habitat. As I understand it, the widening of Anderson Mill was, in part, a safety improvement project to smooth out some of the more dangerous curves in the road. Before the compleOon of this road widening project, there were many automobile collisions into our BCP fence which resulted in some habitat disturbance during repairs. Since this project was completed, there have not been any automobile/fence collisions on our BCP property.
In summary, the widening of this roadway did not violate the terms of the Balcones Canyonlands ConservaOon Plan and there has been no noOceable negaOve impacts to the adjacent Balcones Canyonlands Preserve. I do not believe there is anything the County or the City can do for you in this situaOon, and I don’t believe we have any addiOonal informaOon to supply regarding this completed Anderson Mill Road widening project by the City of Cedar Park.
If you are trying to figure out if this roadway improvement project was completed in compliance with the Federal Endangered Species Act, you may want to consider reaching out to the local US Fish and Wildlife AusOn Ecological Services office.

  The reason for writing this email was to bring to your knowledge that I have been tracking the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd (that the city of Cedar Park) did was next to BCCP land. They did *NOT* took any permissions with BCCP to construct the road. The road is now 0 cm away from the BCCP. The expansion has also impacted my property too. I have used the BCCP tools that you have given to highlight my property. The road that runs between my property and BCCP Land had ~25 ft distance on both sides, but now it is 0 with BCCP and that too without US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b). They also pushed the road next to my property and now it sits with just a 10 ft walkway in between.
When I inquired to City, the engineers told me(verbally) that as the land on either side of the road belongs to the city they are free to do whatever without any permits.
I am looking for a legal answer to the following question in light of this information:
Is such major expansion without permits allowed if the other party owns land next to BCCP. Or is there a special get-away for City officials to do so?
Have the city engineers done the changes to structure within their allowed limits when expanding the road?
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX. I have also sent pictures of expansion and 0 distance between the road and BCCP land earlier to the official BCCP Email but have not gotten any reply.
I have also seen significantly fewer incidents of spotting wildlife and birds in and around my property which may be a result of this construction.
     Page 99 of 141

  So to contrast what is there in actuality and what is on the BCCP site, I am sending screen shorts and links to google earth. The BCCP image shows that there is a clearance between land and road, and google earth shows 0 distance.

The reason for writing this email was to bring to your knowledge that I have been tracking the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd (that the city of Cedar Park) did was next to BCCP land. They did *NOT* took any permissions with BCCP to construct the road. The road is now 0 cm away from the BCCP. The expansion has also impacted my property too. I have used the BCCP tools that you have given to highlight my property. The road that runs between my property and BCCP Land had ~25 ft distance on both sides, but now it is 0 with BCCP and that too without US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b). They also pushed the road next to my property and now it sits with just a 10 ft walkway in between.
When I inquired to City, the engineers told me(verbally) that as the land on either side of the road belongs to the city they are free to do whatever without any permits.
I am looking for a legal answer to the following question in light of this information:
     Page 115 of 141

 Is such major expansion without permits allowed if the other party owns land next to BCCP. Or is there a special get-away for City officials to do so?
Have the city engineers done the changes to structure within their allowed limits when expanding the road?
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX. I have also sent pictures of expansion and 0 distance between the road and BCCP land earlier to the official BCCP Email but have not gotten any reply.
I have also seen significantly fewer incidents of spotting wildlife and birds in and around my property which may be a result of this construction.
So to contrast what is there in actuality and what is on the BCCP site, I am sending screen shorts and links to google earth. The BCCP image shows that there is a clearance between land and road, and google earth shows 0 distance.

Thank you for inquiring about what steps you might need to develop your site. Our program works with landowners and developers to help with Endangered Species Act compliance in western Travis County through an expedited applicaOon and cerOficate process under the BCCP.
The best way to do this is to submit an applicaOon to our program: hops://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/Docs/applicaOon.pdf. You can email me for guidance in filling out the applicaOon if you need to. The applicaOon is simple and the main piece of informaOon that I need is the tax parcel ID; or survey, if it has recently been subdivided.
With informaOon you provide, we use TCAD parcel informaOon and the parOcipaOon zone maps to provide a response back to you with the following: a habitat determinaOon map, any condiOons that may apply if you choose to parOcipate, a quote for miOgaOon costs, and/or next steps and opOons. You can check what habitat fee zones are within your project area using our webmap: hops://arcg.is/0Pqbjb [arcg.is] To use the webmap, search your property using your address or TCAD ID. This map is best viewed on a Desktop computer. Or, if you prefer, you can check on the staOc maps showing habitat zones here: hops://www.traviscountytx.gov/maps. We also use the TCAD parcel informaOon to check to be sure that your site has not already been miOgated or paid for, through our process or a separate US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 10(a) permit. The applicaOon and our response do not commit you to any acOon – this is a service we provide to help inform your opOons. This part of the process – from receipt of your applicaOon to our response – typically takes 15 or fewer days. More informaOon on the process can be found on our website.
Ater you receive our response leoer, we encourage you to review the opOons and email us for any quesOons. If you can parOcipate through our process (only a few sites cannot), you can noOfy us if you are ready to pay the miOgaOon and we will prepare and send a contract for you to sign; you will sign and return with your payment; we will issue the ParOcipaOon CerOficate to you and record with the County Clerk. The cerOficate goes with the property, not the person; so, if you sell the site in the future, the new landowner is covered for development within the same parcel.
       Page 118 of 141

  You do not have to parOcipate with us – you may apply for an ESA 10(a)(1)(B) permit through the local USFWS office by contacOng Paige Najvar at, (512) 490-0057 extension 229, or paige_najvar@fws.gov. Obtaining a USFWS permit can be a lengthy process and entails developing a Habitat ConservaOon Plan including mulOple year species surveys, a miOgaOon proposal, going through a public involvement process, and meeOng all the permit issuance criteria.
Thanks for contacOng Travis County for informaOon. Please feel free to call me if you have any quesOons. I look forward to helping you find an answer to fit your needs.

I just started working on the BCCP, so I will need to look into the answers to your quesOons. But, the document at the link below is the latest set of infrastructure guidelines for the BCP. It is probably the best place to start looking.
hops://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/Docs/drat_plan/Oer_iia- 5_infrastructure_management.pdf
Have you spoken with Kimberlee Harvey at the City of AusOn? She would either have the answers to your quesOons or know where to find them. Here is her contact informaOon:
Kimberlee C. Harvey
Environmental Conservation Program Manager
Secretary of the BCCP Coordinating Committee 512-972-1686 | Kimberlee.Harvey@austintexas.gov
Also, just to follow up a liole on your last email...since the City of AusOn is a permit holder of the BCCP HCP and its associated 10(a)(1)(b) permit and also the owner of the property where the road construcOon has taken place, I am assuming they cleared this project through the BCCP parOcipaOon process within the City. I will check more closely in their annual reports to us to see if they discuss it (and will send you a copy if I find it), but if they just did the construcOon, they may not report on it unOl this December. That may be why I am not finding anything about it yet.

Thank you for inquiring about what steps you might need to develop your site. Our program works with landowners and developers to help with Endangered Species Act compliance in western Travis County through an expedited applicaOon and cerOficate process under the BCCP.
The best way to do this is to submit an applicaOon to our program: hops://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/Docs/applicaOon.pdf. You can email me for guidance in filling out the applicaOon if you need to. The applicaOon is simple and the main piece of informaOon that I need is the tax parcel ID; or survey, if it has recently been subdivided.
With informaOon you provide, we use TCAD parcel informaOon and the parOcipaOon zone maps to provide a response back to you with the following: a habitat determinaOon map, any condiOons that may apply if you choose to parOcipate, a quote for miOgaOon costs, and/or next steps and opOons. You can check what habitat fee zones are within your project area using our webmap: hops://arcg.is/0Pqbjb To use the webmap, search your property using your address or TCAD ID. This map is best viewed on a Desktop computer. Or, if you prefer, you can check on the staOc maps showing habitat zones here: hops://www.traviscountytx.gov/maps. We also use the TCAD parcel informaOon to check to be sure that your site has not already been miOgated or paid for,

  through our process or a separate US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 10(a) permit. The applicaOon and our response do not commit you to any acOon – this is a service we provide to help inform your opOons. This part of the process – from receipt of your applicaOon to our response – typically takes 15 or fewer days. More informaOon on the process can be found on our website.
Ater you receive our response leoer, we encourage you to review the opOons and email us for any quesOons. If you can parOcipate through our process (only a few sites cannot), you can noOfy us if you are ready to pay the miOgaOon and we will prepare and send a contract for you to sign; you will sign and return with your payment; we will issue the ParOcipaOon CerOficate to you and record with the County Clerk. The cerOficate goes with the property, not the person; so, if you sell the site in the future, the new landowner is covered for development within the same parcel.
You do not have to parOcipate with us – you may apply for an ESA 10(a)(1)(B) permit through the local USFWS office by contacOng Paige Najvar at, (512) 490-0057 extension 229, or paige_najvar@fws.gov. Obtaining a USFWS permit can be a lengthy process and entails developing a Habitat ConservaOon Plan including mulOple year species surveys, a miOgaOon proposal, going through a public involvement process, and meeOng all the permit issuance criteria.
Thanks for contacOng Travis County for informaOon. Please feel free to call me if you have any quesOons. I look forward to helping you find an answer to fit your needs.

    Hi,
BCCP documents talk of "permits" to create and develop a structure that is more than 3000 sqft (Major structure is coined in BCCP documents as 3000 sq. ft) near or inside BCCP land. These are covered under - US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b)
Q(1)
If a Builder, a city, or person has land next** to BCCP, do they need permission to construct Major construction such as DAM, ROAD, Ecommerce Warehouses, etc?
Note**: The land, in this case, does not belong to BCCP but is directly attached to BCCP land i.e. distance between them is 0 ft. away from BCCP.
Q(2)
If the participation contract is NOT signed and a BCCP permit (sometimes referred to as BCCP Participation Certificate) is NOT issued, then what is the legal action that BCCP Oaths to take? Is there a section of the law that can be referred or can I be connected with a legal attorney overlooking BCCP legal in this regard?
Q(3)
Whom(Person, Email) shall I get in touch with for legal questions related to the rights of BCCP land?

Dear Katie,
Thank you for your response.
Dear Paige:
I am emailing this under FOIA and will like to share the information and get answers. The request is for parcel
CAD Property ID: 181963
Situs Address: LIME CREEK RD 78641 TCAD Acre: 76.03
GIS Acre: 75.77
Geo ID: 0183370101
More Information
The reason for writing this email was to bring to your knowledge that I have been tracking the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd (that the city of Cedar Park) did was next to BCCP land. They did *NOT* took any permissions with BCCP to construct the road. The road is now 0 cm away from the BCCP. The expansion has also impacted my property too. I have used the BCCP tools that you have given to highlight my property. The road that runs between my property and BCCP Land had ~25 ft distance on both sides, but now it is 0 with BCCP and that too without US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b). They also pushed the road next to my property and now it sits with just a 10 ft walkway in between.
When I inquired to City, the engineers told me(verbally) that as the land on either side of the road belongs to the city they are free to do whatever without any permits.
I am looking for a legal answer to the following question in light of this information:
Is such major expansion without permits allowed if the other party owns land next to BCCP. Or is there a special get-away for City officials to do so?
Have the city engineers done the changes to structure within their allowed limits when expanding the road?
My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX. I have also sent pictures of expansion and 0 distance between the road and BCCP land earlier to the official BCCP Email but have not gotten any reply.
I have also seen significantly fewer incidents of spotting wildlife and birds in and around my property which may be a result of this construction.
So to contrast what is there in actuality and what is on the BCCP site, I am sending screen shorts and links to google earth. The BCCP image shows that there is a clearance between land and road, and google earth shows 0 distance.
