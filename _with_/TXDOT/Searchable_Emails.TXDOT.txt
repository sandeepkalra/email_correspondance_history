Hi DOT.GOV:
Around 2 months back I submitted to your hotline facts and proofs explaining how many city officials in most of texas are
ignoring safety and are fooling the public of the USA with fraud estimation documents.
I got directly affected by 1 project and a few city engineers but the point I raised is not limited to 1 engineer, 1 project, or 1 city. In theory, this may be going on more widespread than you may think. I am not going to judge this, but for sure history will. After all, many of these so-called "engineers" (mostly with hollow or shallow knowledge) will soon work for the US-led trillion $$ Infra project and showcase to the world how this is done.
In the last 20 yrs, this single fact may have in total killed more Americans than what this country lost in Afgan war in 20 yrs. And in the end, is there any justice to the plaintiff here?
Is there any justice for me? I will like to know if you are doing "anything" with this complaint and substance I have provided or was it just a unfortunate form-filling task that I did with a dead-end ahead of me?

their head in the sand and assume never saw anything?

Mr. Kalra,
We received this Hotline Complaint from you regarding allega[ons that the City of Cedar Park is “building roads without any safety calcula[ons”. However, there was nothing to support any of the allega[ons or your claims.
What type of “safety calcula[ons” are not being done by the City of Cedar Park?
[SandeepK] The city engineers, and contract firms decided to pull the road next to residents property (earlier the distance was 35ft + walkway of 7 feet, and now at some point as close as 11 feet with only safety of a 6 inch curb. City also removed 50+ yrs old trees that were also acting as protection) but did not follow PE guidelines and did "no"(none, zero) engineering safety calculation as per TBPE guidelines (Proof: https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/enf_pub.pdf, section 1001.003, 137.33 e, and lookup word "calculations") such as what kind of vehicle and what speed is safe for this kind of structure. They were supposed to use physics, and maths to do safety calculations. Instead they only did "accounting estimates" and posted them against estimates. One of the sides of the road is open to winds as it faces BCCP land and there is no structure there. YouTube is filled with videos such as these (one such Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG22JlcZnMk) that shows that high wind will make 18 wheelers fly. With no barrier, or gap between property and road except walkway a high wind can cause catastrophe to pedestrians.
I also pointed out that the 18 wheelers had in the past converted a pebble on the road as a vehicle to destroy a brand new installed fence(proof attached as screen shot). Email to city engineers showed with picture proof how a pebble from a speeding truck tore the wooden fence. There could have been a kid in that spot.
A drunk driver on a truck also is a moving missile. I hope you do not want proof of this. You can fetch thousands of reports from any police department.
Video proof of such trucks travelling unlawfully in the locality (some caring fuel). Unfortunately the angle of installation fails to capture incoming traffic and mostly capture outgoing:

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof.

   The earlier distance between walkway to road distance would have prevented any of these 3 cases. A new structure was implemented when I raised the concerns in writing (concerns.pdf, proof attached) with all these points raised. Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been
 Page 4 of 61

 involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allega[ons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calcula[ons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
What ac[on do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allega[ons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid
   Page 5 of 61

 possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road.
2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place.
5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.
In order for us to consider these claims, please provide any suppor[ng informa[on or documenta[on. Thank you,

Descrip[on of the fraud, waste, and/or abuse:
Fraud & Abuse of powers - This may apply to a lot of US ci[es in Texas, but certainly my city - Cedar Park TX (78613) is one, and the [meframe of the abuse men[oned here goes in YEARS *25+ years*.
The city engineers have been building roads without any safety calcula[ons. They outsource drawings from other firms where also there are no safety calcula[ons done. City engineers (Licensed and unlicensed combined) do not push the firms to do the calcula[ons.
T.B.P.E (Texas Board of PE Engineers) was contacted in this respect too, but they said that they cannot rule over decisions made by city P.E. engineers. This has been happening from last 25+ years in Cedar Park. From the sense of interac[on with city and TBPE it seems not wrong to assume that this has been prac[ce in a lot texas ci[es. (Cannot say for sure for other ci[es - but they were not surprised by the learnings). On asking for calcula[ons, city provided me with what Engineers has been submisng as "calcula[ons" and "es[mates" and it was actually "accoun[ng calcula[ons". Cedar Park TX is just 20 miles from Aus[n capital. You can extrapolate to see what is the level of engineering fraud going on.
All data men[oned by me above here is backed by FOIA, and wriaen communica[on with TBPE, Cedar Park City Council, Cedar Park City Engineers. I can present my data if needed. More so, the cedar park city has not indicated to me that they will take any ac[on w.r.t this.
I as a student am also interested in running Machine learning regression algo. to find the correla[on but could not find dataset on your website NHSTA w.r.t. any accident studies done where the correla[on to this parameters were studied. I will equally be interested in finding the data to run models myself (if anything or this sort was collected earlier). In case there is data available, then i will like to see that data.

Hi,
Thanks for getting back to me. This is the first reponse with a conclusion and I have for some reason not received your previous response.
At this point, I will like to know that if it is not FHWA and DOT that oversights the development of public infrastructure such as roads developed by the city then which government office/institute plays that role. ?
Any pointer will be greatly appreciated.

What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allega[ons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calcula[ons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
   Page 16 of 61

 What ac[on do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allega[ons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road.
2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place.
5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.
In order for us to consider these claims, please provide any suppor[ng informa[on or documenta[on. Thank you,

What type of “safety calcula[ons” are not being done by the City of Cedar Park?
[SandeepK] The city engineers, and contract firms decided to pull the road next to residents property (earlier the distance was 35ft + walkway of 7 feet, and now at some point as close as 11 feet with only safety of a 6 inch curb. City also removed 50+ yrs old trees that were also acting as protection) but did not follow PE guidelines and did "no"(none, zero) engineering safety calculation as per TBPE guidelines (Proof: https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/enf_pub.pdf, section 1001.003, 137.33 e, and lookup word "calculations") such as what kind of vehicle and what speed is safe for this kind of structure. They were supposed to use physics, and maths to do safety calculations. Instead they only did "accounting estimates" and posted them against estimates. One of the sides of the road is open to winds as it faces BCCP land and there is no structure there. YouTube is filled with videos such as these (one such Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG22JlcZnMk) that shows that high wind will make 18 wheelers fly. With no barrier, or gap between property and road except walkway a high wind can cause catastrophe to pedestrians.
I also pointed out that the 18 wheelers had in the past converted a pebble on the road as a vehicle to destroy a brand new installed fence(proof attached as screen shot). Email to city engineers showed with picture proof how a pebble from a speeding truck tore the wooden fence. There could have been a kid in that spot.
A drunk driver on a truck also is a moving missile. I hope you do not want proof of this. You can fetch thousands of reports from any police department.
Video proof of such trucks travelling unlawfully in the locality (some caring fuel). Unfortunately the angle of installation fails to capture incoming traffic and mostly capture outgoing:

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof. For proof sake i am attaching just one of the email threads. They go really long.

   The earlier distance between walkway to road distance would have prevented any of these 3 cases. A new structure was implemented when I raised the concerns in writing (concerns.pdf, proof attached) with all these points raised. Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been

involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
 What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allega[ons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof. For proof sake i am attaching just one of the email threads. They go really long.

   The earlier distance between walkway to road distance would have prevented any of these 3 cases. A new structure was implemented when I raised the concerns in writing (concerns.pdf, proof attached) with all these points raised. Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allega[ons being made?
Page 31 of 61

On what type of roads or projects are these allega[ons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calcula[ons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
What ac[on do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allega[ons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road.
2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place.
   Page 32 of 61

5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.
In order for us to consider these claims, please provide any suppor[ng informa[on or documenta[on. Thank you,

The city engineers have been building roads without any safety calcula[ons. They outsource drawings from other firms where also there are no safety calcula[ons done. City engineers (Licensed and unlicensed combined) do not push the firms to do the calcula[ons.
T.B.P.E (Texas Board of PE Engineers) was contacted in this respect too, but they said that they cannot rule over decisions made by city P.E. engineers. This has been happening from last 25+ years in Cedar Park. From the sense of interac[on with city and TBPE it seems not wrong to assume that this has been prac[ce in a lot texas ci[es. (Cannot say for sure for other ci[es - but they were not surprised by the learnings). On asking for calcula[ons, city provided me with what Engineers has been submisng as "calcula[ons" and "es[mates" and it was actually "accoun[ng calcula[ons". Cedar Park TX is just 20 miles from Aus[n capital. You can extrapolate to see what is the level of engineering fraud going on.
All data men[oned by me above here is backed by FOIA, and wriaen communica[on with TBPE, Cedar Park City Council, Cedar Park City Engineers. I can present my data if needed. More so, the cedar park city has not indicated to me that they will take any ac[on w.r.t this.

In the United States, there are approximately 2 million big rig trucks. Nationally, about 500,000 accidents involving 18-wheeler trucks occur yearly. Of those accidents, an estimated 5,000 result in death. Of these fatalities, 98 percent are the death of the driver or a passenger of the vehicle other than the 18-wheeler involved.
Large, heavy truck accidents cause approximately 130,000 injuries every year in the U.S.
The time of day you are driving can also make you safer on the road. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, most truck crashes occurred between noon and 3:00 p.m. in 2014. With a total of 17 percent of all truck crashes throughout the day and night happening between these hours, it resulted in the deaths of 622 individuals.

According to the Large Truck Crash Causation Study conducted for the FMCSA:
Twenty-seven percent of trucks were found to have brake problems Nineteen percent of drivers were unfamiliar with the route
10 percent of truck drivers felt under pressure
Seven percent were overly tired
Three percent experienced tire problems
Five percent were driving in an aggressive manner
One percent were ill
0.4 percent were under the influence of illegal substances 0.3 percent had been consuming alcohol

I appreciate you confirming that there are no calcula[ons done. I am not a judge on the meaning of words. I have just expressed what it means to me and you have expressed your thoughts. You do not take my interpreta[on, and nor will I not take yours or LeAnn's. T.B.P.E. published it and owns it and they are there to clarify. We as engineers must abide to it. They will let us know.
The fact of maaer is that this property unlike any other property in Cedar Park, this property is sisng at less than 10 z from road with no protec[on where there is a WB-19[WB-62] trucks are allowed(northbound) to pass and they can speed anywhere between 45MPH to 40 MPH. They are not restricted from turning right either, and even if the restric[ons are put in place there are 0 checks to handle it. With a turn lane, the possibili[es of the overtaking cannot be overruled. A simple Curb cannot deflect traffic.
This pathway is used by not just me, or my family but by school kids, joggers and bicyclists too. I am not a "assump[on" guy as you are but just for the sake of argument if I put some schenarios here
(a) assume that just one of the driver is [red, and drizs at 3:00 PM when school kids are walking back, then you all will be responsible. A wooden fence isn't good for me/my family to even sit in my own backyard at any [me.
(b) My son plays frisbie with me. What if that flies out and someone goes to pick it while a mishap is sisng there to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.
How can the engineers overlook it even azer this was men[oned in first mee[ng. I have audio-recording from Brian where we told the city in first mee[ng that students travel that path, drunk drivers have crashed in(southbound), and there is a need for safety study to be done if it hasn't been done. Was that asking for our concern a joke or just a check-list so that we are informed?
One day I might sell this property and move out but un[l that happens and if I live there in that place and face this 24x7x365. I will always feel unsafe if this situa[on isn't resolved. You give me just 20 such proper[es in whole Cedar Park where you all have done something similar and big trucks comes at 45mph and you have not seen any problem.I have posted about this in wri[ng to engineering team in first mee[ng. I even read it loud in mee[ng on that day. I am aaaching it right now (concerns.pdf) again for everyone reference.
These drawings are flawed and this is a case of gross negligence on part of everyone who has worked on the project and overlooked these aspects. This isn't engineering at all.
When the drawings were made (shows less than 6 z distance between curb and fence) then someone must have either overridden the safety clause of it is in part responsibility even goes to the drazer and engineer for laying out this plan.
I invite anyone and everyone here to put his/her opinion, facts. Sandeep

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specifica[ons) and “E” (Es[mate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specifica[ons for the project as well as links to where those specifica[ons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the es[mate although we disagree as to what the term “es[mate” is defined as. The es[mate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construc[on of the project.
The calcula[ons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construc[on plans and the only calcula[ons that they performed are the drainage calcula[ons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of Aus[n Transporta[on Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross sec[on design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transporta[on engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informa[on and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 mee[ng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I no[ced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contac[ng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addi[onal ques[ons.

Let address some of the issues that you men[on below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I men[oned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are decelera[ng.
           Page 44 of 61

      Second, we have not lied, hidden informa[on or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot sisng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calcula[ons you are looking for. The roadway cross sec[ons can be found in the City of Aus[n’s Transporta[on Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross sec[ons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American Associa[on of State Highway Transporta[on Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and azernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.

Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be decelera[ng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes.

In the United States, there are approximately 2 million big rig trucks. Nationally, about 500,000 accidents involving 18-wheeler trucks occur yearly. Of those accidents, an estimated 5,000 result in death. Of these fatalities, 98 percent are the death of the driver or a passenger of the vehicle other than the 18-wheeler involved.
Large, heavy truck accidents cause approximately 130,000 injuries every year in the U.S.
The time of day you are driving can also make you safer on the road. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, most truck crashes occurred between noon and 3:00 p.m. in 2014. With a total of 17 percent of all truck crashes throughout the day and night happening between these hours, it resulted in the deaths of 622 individuals.

According to the Large Truck Crash Causation Study conducted for the FMCSA:
Twenty-seven percent of trucks were found to have brake problems Nineteen percent of drivers were unfamiliar with the route
10 percent of truck drivers felt under pressure
Seven percent were overly tired
Three percent experienced tire problems

I appreciate you confirming that there are no calcula[ons done. I am not a judge on the meaning of words. I have just expressed what it means to me and you have expressed your thoughts. You do not take my interpreta[on, and nor will I not take yours or LeAnn's. T.B.P.E. published it and owns it and they are there to clarify. We as engineers must abide to it. They will let us know.
The fact of maaer is that this property unlike any other property in Cedar Park, this property is sisng at less than 10 z from road with no protec[on where there is a WB-19[WB-62] trucks are allowed(northbound) to pass and they can speed anywhere between 45MPH to 40 MPH. They are not restricted from turning right either, and even if the restric[ons are put in place there are 0 checks to handle it. With a turn lane, the possibili[es of the overtaking cannot be overruled. A simple Curb cannot deflect traffic.
This pathway is used by not just me, or my family but by school kids, joggers and bicyclists too. I am not a "assump[on" guy as you are but just for the sake of argument if I put some schenarios here
(a) assume that just one of the driver is [red, and drizs at 3:00 PM when school kids are walking back, then you all will be responsible. A wooden fence isn't good for me/my family to even sit in my own backyard at any [me.
(b) My son plays frisbie with me. What if that flies out and someone goes to pick it while a mishap is sisng there to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.
How can the engineers overlook it even azer this was men[oned in first mee[ng. I have audio-recording from Brian where we told the city in first mee[ng that students travel that path, drunk drivers have crashed in(southbound), and there is a need for safety study to be done if it hasn't been done. Was that asking for our concern a joke or just a check-list so that we are informed?
One day I might sell this property and move out but un[l that happens and if I live there in that place and face this 24x7x365. I will always feel unsafe if this situa[on isn't resolved. You give me just 20 such proper[es in whole Cedar Park where you all have done something similar and big trucks comes at 45mph and you have not seen any problem.I have posted about this in wri[ng to engineering team in first mee[ng. I even read it loud in mee[ng on that day. I am aaaching it right now (concerns.pdf) again for everyone reference.
These drawings are flawed and this is a case of gross negligence on part of everyone who has worked on the project and overlooked these aspects. This isn't engineering at all.
When the drawings were made (shows less than 6 z distance between curb and fence) then someone must have either overridden the safety clause of it is in part responsibility even goes to the drazer and engineer for laying out
   Page 52 of 61

either overridden the safety clause of it is in part responsibility even goes to the drazer and engineer for laying out

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specifica[ons) and “E” (Es[mate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specifica[ons for the project as well as links to where those specifica[ons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the es[mate although we disagree as to what the term “es[mate” is defined as. The es[mate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construc[on of the project.
The calcula[ons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construc[on plans and the only calcula[ons that they performed are the drainage calcula[ons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of Aus[n Transporta[on Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross sec[on design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transporta[on engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informa[on and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 mee[ng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
       Page 53 of 61

 I no[ced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contac[ng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addi[onal ques[ons.

Let address some of the issues that you men[on below.
          Page 56 of 61

      First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I men[oned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are decelera[ng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informa[on or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot sisng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calcula[ons you are looking for. The roadway cross sec[ons can be found in the City of Aus[n’s Transporta[on Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross sec[ons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American Associa[on of State Highway Transporta[on Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.
