Filename: Hi FHWA,

I have been recommended by DOT.gov to send this info to FHWA Tx Division instead. Please find the email with the details below. I am not sure if this comes
under the whistleblower act or not, but it is serious matter as it impacts life of a lot of Americans on the road.

I recommend you to look into the matter, and if there were no studies done, then do some to see if decisions such as these are impacting or not.

Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra

  Description of the fraud, waste, and/or abuse:
Fraud & Abuse of powers - This may apply to a lot of US cities in Texas, but certainly my city - Cedar Park TX (78613) is one, and the timeframe of the abuse mentioned here goes in YEARS *25+ years*.

The city engineers have been building roads without any safety calculations. They outsource drawings from other firms where also there are no safety calculations done. City engineers (Licensed and unlicensed combined) do not push the firms to do the calculations.

T.B.P.E (Texas Board of PE Engineers) was contacted in this respect too, but they said that they cannot rule over decisions made by city P.E. engineers. This has been happening from last 25+ years in Cedar Park. From the sense of interaction with city and TBPE it seems not wrong to assume that this  has been practice in a lot texas cities.  (Cannot say for sure for other cities - but they were not surprised by the learnings). On asking for calculations, city provided me with what Engineers has been submitting as "calculations" and "estimates" and it was actually "accounting calculations". Cedar Park TX is just 20 miles from Austin capital. You can extrapolate to see what is the level of engineering fraud going on.

All data mentioned by me above here is backed by FOIA, and written communication with TBPE, Cedar Park City Council, Cedar Park City Engineers. I can present my data if needed. More so, the cedar park city has not indicated to me that they will take any action w.r.t this.

I as a student am also interested in running Machine learning regression algo. to find the correlation but could not find dataset on your website NHSTA w.r.t. any accident studies done where the correlation to this parameters were studied.  I will equally be interested in finding the data to run models myself (if anything or this sort was collected earlier). In case there is data available, then i will like to see that data.
