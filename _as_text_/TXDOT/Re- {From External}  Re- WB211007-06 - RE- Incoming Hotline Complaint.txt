Filename: Hi,

Thanks for getting back to me. This is the first reponse with a conclusion and I have for some reason not received your previous response.

At this point, I will like to know that if it is not FHWA and DOT that oversights the development of public infrastructure such as roads developed by the city then which government office/institute plays that role. ?

Any pointer will be greatly appreciated.

Hi DOT.GOV<http://DOT.GOV>:

Around 2 months back I submitted to your hotline facts and proofs explaining how many city officials in most of texas are ignoring safety and are fooling the public of the USA with fraud estimation documents.

I got directly affected by 1 project and a few city engineers but the point I raised is not limited to 1 engineer, 1 project, or 1 city.  In theory, this may be going on more widespread than you may think. I am not going to judge this, but for sure history will. After all, many of these so-called "engineers" (mostly with hollow or shallow knowledge) will soon work for the US-led trillion $$ Infra project and showcase to the world how this is done.

In the last 20 yrs, this single fact may have in total killed more Americans than what this country lost in Afgan war in 20 yrs. And in the end, is there any justice to the plaintiff here?

Is there any justice for me? I will like to know if you are doing "anything" with this complaint and substance I have provided or was it just a unfortunate form-filling task that I did with a dead-end ahead of me?

PS: Marking copy to Wilco. They are funding $ to these cities from the tax they collect. Why should they play Ostrich who has their head in the sand and assume never saw anything?

Dear Mr. Carl:

Please find my answers below, tagged [sandeepk].

I am ready to work out with you all to give more information as this one email is not enough to completely carry the load of all (I have 40+MB of digital data, voice recordings, emails, pictures, proofs)
