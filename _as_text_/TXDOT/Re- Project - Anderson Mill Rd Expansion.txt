In the United States, there are approximately 2 million big rig trucks. Nationally, about 500,000 accidents involving 18-wheeler trucks occur yearly. Of those accidents, an estimated 5,000 result in death. Of these fatalities, 98 percent are the death of the driver or a passenger of the vehicle other than the 18-wheeler involved.

Large, heavy truck accidents cause approximately 130,000 injuries every year in the U.S.




The time of day you are driving can also make you safer on the road. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, most truck crashes occurred between noon and 3:00 p.m. in 2014. With a total of 17 percent of all truck crashes throughout the day and night happening between these hours, it resulted in the deaths of 622 individuals.

According to the Large Truck Crash Causation Study conducted for the FMCSA:

  *   Twenty-seven percent of trucks were found to have brake problems
  *   Nineteen percent of drivers were unfamiliar with the route
  *   10 percent of truck drivers felt under pressure
  *   Seven percent were overly tired
  *   Three percent experienced tire problems
  *   Five percent were driving in an aggressive manner
  *   One percent were ill
  *   0.4 percent were under the influence of illegal substances
  *   0.3 percent had been consuming alcohol

Darwin,

I appreciate you confirming that there are no calculations done. I am not a judge on the meaning of words. I have just expressed what it means to me and you have expressed your thoughts.  You do not take my interpretation, and nor will I not take yours or LeAnn's. T.B.P.E. published it and owns it and they are there to clarify. We as engineers must abide to it. They will let us know.

The fact of matter is that this property unlike any other property in Cedar Park, this property is sitting at less than 10 ft from road with no protection where there is a WB-19[WB-62] trucks are allowed(northbound) to pass and they can speed anywhere between 45MPH to 40 MPH. They are not restricted from turning right either, and even if the restrictions are put in place there are 0 checks to handle it. With a turn lane, the possibilities of the overtaking cannot be overruled. A simple Curb cannot deflect traffic.

This pathway is used by not just me, or my family but by school kids, joggers and bicyclists too. I am not a "assumption" guy as you are but just for the sake of argument if I put some schenarios here
(a) assume that just one of the driver is tired, and drifts at 3:00 PM when school kids are walking back, then you all will be responsible. A wooden fence isn't good for me/my family to even sit in my own backyard at any time.
(b) My son plays frisbie with me. What if that flies out and someone goes to pick it while a mishap is sitting there to happen? I am not going to sit idle and let this to happen to anyone for a stupid fence.

 How can the engineers overlook it even after this was mentioned in first meeting. I have audio-recording from Brian where we told the city in first meeting that students travel that path, drunk drivers have crashed in(southbound), and there is a need for safety study to be done if it hasn't been done. Was that asking for our concern a joke or just a check-list so that we are informed?

One day I might sell this property and move out but until that happens and if I live there in that place and face this 24x7x365. I will always feel unsafe if this situation isn't resolved. You give me just 20 such properties in whole Cedar Park where you all have done something similar and big trucks comes at 45mph and you have not seen any problem.I have posted about this in writing to engineering team in first meeting. I even read it loud in meeting on that day. I am attaching it right now (concerns.pdf) again for everyone reference.

These drawings are flawed and this is a case of gross negligence on part of everyone who has worked on the project and overlooked these aspects. This isn't engineering at all.
When the drawings were made (shows less than 6 ft distance between curb and fence) then someone must have either overridden the safety clause of it is in part responsibility even goes to the drafter and engineer for laying out this plan.

I invite anyone and everyone here to put his/her opinion, facts.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specifications) and “E” (Estimate) part of the PS&E for the project.  We provided you with the specifications for the project as well as links to where those specifications can be found on Wednesday.  We also provided the estimate although we disagree as to what the term “estimate” is defined as.  The estimate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construction of the project.

The calculations that you have requested simply do not exist.  I have checked with the engineer that designed these construction plans and the only calculations that they performed are the drainage calculations which are found in the plans.  As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of Austin Transportation Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual.  These manuals are used as a basis for the cross section design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway.  These design criteria are used by transportation engineers throughout Texas and the United States.

I was hoping to relay this information and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeting yesterday at your house.  We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.

I noticed that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email.  I would suggest contacting Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,
Darwin

Section 1001.407 TBPE Guide for any license engineer working on "Public Work" must support his work with 3 parts (a) Plan (b) Specifications and (3) Estimates.
I am asking for the (b) and (c). They must be in your possession from the person who sealed the design plan.

Am I wrong in assuming that licensed engineers have to abide to the TBPE Rule guide?

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you mention below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane.  As I mentioned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are decelerating.
Second, we have not lied, hidden information or misled you in any way.  In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.   The handrail is not located on the property line.  There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk.  The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot sitting right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated.  These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculations you are looking for.  The roadway cross sections can be found in the City of Austin’s Transportation Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted.  The cross sections and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials) design manual.  This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Darwin

Alan, Darwin,

When I talked to you and others in first meeting at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ ft distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other location... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumatized us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).

There is a 12 ft sitting right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

I am not buying your speculations and assumptions and speculation about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculations that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situation will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?

If I find flaw in calculations or no calculations to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporting this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's mentioned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 ft from the property line.

Hi Darwin,

There are a lot of "assumptions" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.

The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.

I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and afternoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.

I hope you understand that all liabilities will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representative of the city of cedar park) to decide and take action (or not).


Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property.  The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane.  The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gutter to provide an additional barrier for traffic.  Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be decelerating to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes.  The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes.  There will also be a raised curb and gutter median that will provide additional separation to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this location.  The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properties are on a curve in the roadway.  Since your property is on a straight section of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locations, a barrier is not warranted in this location.  I hope this information is helpful.  Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,

Hi Darwin,

I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converting from existing 2 lanes to 4 lanes.

When this project started, we had a meeting with the city, and I clearly mentioned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, pollution etc. In the city meeting, we were told that the city will give a 3 ft fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).

The arguments given by Alan are not satisfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.

Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?
