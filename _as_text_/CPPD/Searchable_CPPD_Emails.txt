As you can see that the truck was fuel truck and travelling less than 10m or less away from school bus in an unauthorised place, i have few questions that you must investigate and write back to reply all in this email
(and also because I do not want you and law-firm niemannlaw.com reps to find yourself gullible to lying by some small time driver of ranger company):
0. Was the vehicle travelling with fuel or without fuel?
1. What was the Vehicle number, driver's name, driver's contact, and time when washing was done?
2. please also collect if i have to cross verify with the wash company about driver, vehicle (collect footage of the washing if possible).

Can you confirm again with the source?
I want the statement from Ranger saying "the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around" to be legally verifiable and recorded.
It will help if you can clarify "wash down Anderson Mill Road" .. is this truck cleaning service ? and at what location is this service on Anderson Mill road?

Thanks a lot .. I appreciate the response and a quick follow up. I have always found CPPD very helpful and acting immediately as and when they can, but at the same time I understand or at least it appears that city and hoa is reluctant to help on this matter in a permanent way.
Thanks again for the excellent service.

Thank you for contacTng us and bringing this maUer to our aUenTon. We are deeply commiUed to the safety of Cedar Park residents and diligently work to keep our neighborhood roadways safe.
We have contacted Ranger about this incident and were informed that the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around. Ranger has assured us that the driver’s supervisor has instructed the driver not to uTlize Gaspar in the future.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further quesTons.

Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting
        Page 2 of 63

    solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus.

I requested you to write to the City on Aug-24-2022. Have you given in writing the concerns of the people of Buttercup creek to Cedar Park City?
Can you please send me proof that you have done so?
Here is one truck today(Oct-04-2022): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPaNjeytHNnIpMsTSblggkizoGh896Di/view? usp=sharing
This is 18 wheeler Ranger Truck loaded with rocks. A small accident from this truck is enough to kill any resident on the spot.
     Page 5 of 63

  Another incident: 2 weeks back a truck that passed our neighborhood dropped pebbles on the way. The stones are spread all through Gaspar bend, Steven Ct., Lauren Trail, and Nelson loop (and may be more places in the neighborhood). The stones are still lying on the road and no one is cleaning them. Look around, especially the curves where the truck took turns *such as the intersection of Anderson mill and Gaspar, intersection of Gaspar and Steven Ct, etc.
One such pebble has once caused serious damage to my fence as a speeding car just converted it to a projectile. The fense tore by the impact, and you can still visit to see the damage. This was in 2017 or 2018 and even after writing (with photo proof) to city engineers, and no-one showed up. I am still waiting here (year 2022). Imagine some person standing and got hit by that stone.
I think that the Cedar Park City and This HOA must exchange some mails/emails through their lawyers to finalize 'who will be liable' if these incidents carry on and one day cause a loss of life or even cause an accident. Will the city pay or HOA will pay to the person impacted. Do let me know if either party needs proof that these incidents happened or not. I will help to
my fullest with the recordings.

My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, _cedar park, tx 78613. It is at the intersection of gaspar bend and anderson mill road.
Since the last 4+ years multiple commercial 18-wheelers trucks loaded with stones, and many times with fuel, have crossed the neighborhood. Each entrance to the neighborhood has a "no pass through trucks" sign. They are not allowed in the neighborhood hence they are "unauthorized".
The video proofs are all shared links and you may open from any public computer or cell phone. If they do not work for you, I can work to upload them all to youtube for you. Does youtube work for you? There must be 25+ incidents each year, and in many cases the zoomed up picture will show the license number, etc. In all my reports, I have also mentioned the day and time. All my emails can also be uploaded to GITHUB so that they can be seen from any public computer. I have sent documents to the Williamson county legal department using github earlier.. they have not reported any issue of being unable to open. In total the proofs are in Gigabyte and cannot be shared as direct zip files.
This intersection and most of the road projects that city engineers developed in the last 30 years *was without any* safety checks. A typical truck entering and exiting the neighborhood crosses at least 50+ houses (or +/- 200 people) and at least crosses 1 elementary school connection road. A written proof from a licensed cedar park city engineer plus the cross validation of the design document can be produced if asked for (here or in court).
This makes me and my family and hundreds of more neighbors susceptible to safety risk. The local HOA and City are not acting on it. They are not open to work while holding the position that they fought for in elections and to serve..They may be purposefully hurting people if they are not acting on it and that is what it looks like to me now after chasing it for years and seeing 0 results. I will be requesting communication between HOA and City under FOIA and send you the response to FOIA

0. Was the vehicle travelling with fuel or without fuel?
1. What was the Vehicle number, driver's name, driver's contact, and time when washing was done?
2. please also collect if i have to cross verify with the wash company about driver, vehicle (collect footage of the washing if possible).

Can you confirm again with the source?
I want the statement from Ranger saying "the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around" to be legally verifiable and recorded.
It will help if you can clarify "wash down Anderson Mill Road" .. is this truck cleaning service ? and at what location is this service on Anderson Mill road?

   Thanks a lot .. I appreciate the response and a quick follow up. I have always found CPPD very helpful and acting immediately as and when they can, but at the same time I understand or at least it appears that city and hoa is reluctant to help on this matter in a permanent way.
Thanks again for the excellent service.

Thank you for contacTng us and bringing this maUer to our aUenTon. We are deeply commiUed to the safety of Cedar Park residents and diligently work to keep our neighborhood roadways safe.
We have contacted Ranger about this incident and were informed that the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around. Ranger has assured us that the driver’s supervisor has instructed the driver not to uTlize Gaspar in the future.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further quesTons.

    kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).

EXTERNAL email: Exercise cauLon when opening.
Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMOVYTAOaw3S3p90qO9n8iix65hzS9rw/view?usp=sharing https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AiMpwJCfoCqKmzN33ZYPC_6nwObtV6SY/view?usp=sharing

Dear Connie Odom:
While I am still waiting for your official reply, I thought I would help you with the viewing of the videos. For that reason I uploaded not so new videos to youtube. I would like you to confirm if these are playable at your end or not. If yes, we can start uploading more on your request. Alternately, I would like you to open a FTP server for me to upload or better ship a 16GB USB drive that I can load things and give back to you.

My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, _cedar park, tx 78613. It is at the intersection of gaspar bend and anderson mill road.
Since the last 4+ years multiple commercial 18-wheelers trucks loaded with stones, and many times with fuel, have crossed the neighborhood. Each entrance to the neighborhood has a "no pass through trucks" sign. They are not allowed in the neighborhood hence they are "unauthorized".
The video proofs are all shared links and you may open from any public computer or cell phone. If they do not work for you, I can work to upload them all to youtube for you. Does youtube work for you? There must be 25+ incidents each year, and in many cases the zoomed up picture will show the license number, etc. In all my reports, I have also mentioned the day and time. All my emails can also be uploaded to GITHUB so that they can be seen from any public computer. I have sent
            Page 35 of 63

 documents to the Williamson county legal department using github earlier.. they have not reported any issue of being unable to open. In total the proofs are in Gigabyte and cannot be shared as direct zip files.
This intersection and most of the road projects that city engineers developed in the last 30 years *was without any* safety checks. A typical truck entering and exiting the neighborhood crosses at least 50+ houses (or +/- 200 people) and at least crosses 1 elementary school connection road. A written proof from a licensed cedar park city engineer plus the cross validation of the design document can be produced if asked for (here or in court).
This makes me and my family and hundreds of more neighbors susceptible to safety risk. The local HOA and City are not acting on it. They are not open to work while holding the position that they fought for in elections and to serve..They may be purposefully hurting people if they are not acting on it and that is what it looks like to me now after chasing it for years and seeing 0 results.

As you can see that the truck was fuel truck and travelling less than 10m or less away from school bus in an unauthorised place, i have few questions that you must investigate and write back to reply all in this email
(and also because I do not want you and law-firm niemannlaw.com reps to find yourself gullible to lying by some small time driver of ranger company):
0. Was the vehicle travelling with fuel or without fuel?
1. What was the Vehicle number, driver's name, driver's contact, and time when washing was done?
2. please also collect if i have to cross verify with the wash company about driver, vehicle (collect footage of the washing if possible).

It will help if you can clarify "wash down Anderson Mill Road" .. is this truck cleaning service ? and at what location is this service on Anderson Mill road?

I have sent documents to the Williamson county legal department using github earlier.. they have not reported any issue of being unable to open. In total the proofs are in Gigabyte and cannot be shared as direct zip files.
This intersection and most of the road projects that city engineers developed in the last 30 years *was without any* safety checks. A typical truck entering and exiting the neighborhood crosses at least 50+ houses (or +/- 200 people) and at least crosses 1 elementary school connection road. A written proof from a licensed cedar park city engineer plus the cross validation of the design document can be produced if asked for (here or in court).
This makes me and my family and hundreds of more neighbors susceptible to safety risk. The local HOA and City are not acting on it. They are not open to work while holding the position that they fought for in elections and to serve..They may be purposefully hurting people if they are not acting on it and that is what it looks like to me now after chasing it for years and seeing 0 results. I will be requesting communication between HOA and City under FOIA and send you the response to FOIA once I file it with the city.
I am open to emails, have recorded zoom meetings with you, upload proofs to any public site - youtube, github, google-shared

    Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper- pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMOVYTAOaw3S3p90qO9n8iix65hzS9rw/view?usp=sharing https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AiMpwJCfoCqKmzN33ZYPC_6nwObtV6SY/view?usp=sharing

I requested you to write to the City on Aug-24-2022. Have you given in writing the concerns of the people of Buttercup creek to Cedar Park City?
Can you please send me proof that you have done so?
Here is one truck today(Oct-04-2022): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPaNjeytHNnIpMsTSblggkizoGh896Di/view? usp=sharing
This is 18 wheeler Ranger Truck loaded with rocks. A small accident from this truck is enough to kill any resident on the spot.
Another incident: 2 weeks back a truck that passed our neighborhood dropped pebbles on the way. The stones are spread all through Gaspar bend, Steven Ct., Lauren Trail, and Nelson loop (and may be more places in the neighborhood). The stones are still lying on the road and no one is cleaning them. Look around, especially the curves where the truck took turns *such as the intersection of Anderson mill and Gaspar, intersection of Gaspar and Steven Ct, etc.
One such pebble has once caused serious damage to my fence as a speeding car just converted it to a projectile. The fense tore by the impact, and you can still visit to see the damage. This was in 2017 or 2018 and even after writing (with photo proof) to city engineers, and no-one showed up. I am still waiting here (year 2022). Imagine some person standing and got hit by that stone.
I think that the Cedar Park City and This HOA must exchange some mails/emails through their lawyers to finalize 'who will be liable' if these incidents carry on and one day cause a loss of life or even cause an accident. Will the city pay or HOA will pay to the person impacted. Do let me know if either party needs proof that these incidents happened or not. I will help to
my fullest with the recordings.

Dear Cedar Park City Council:
Lately I am again seeing Ranger trucks out here in the neighborhood. I am marking you in "TO" and CPPD in CC, as I think the onus is more on Council here.
I see that your mission and charter statements both mention "public safety", so please act on this request. Kindly block all heavy vehicles from taking neighborhood roads.
There are kids, pedestrians, and many more that are at risk.
I will also request HOA to start thinking about installing private entrance gates with some electronic fobs at all entrances and exits if the situation is not solvable otherwise.
I can send video proofs if you want. I just witnessed one right now (Friday MArch -25, @5:32PM CST). This is the 3rd incident I have seen in the last 2 weeks.
