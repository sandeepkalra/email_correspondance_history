Filename: Thanks Paige. The project actually ended in 2019, so any documents from City must be on file.
The city that did the development is "City of Cedar Park". And from FOIA I came to know that
they have not taken any permits 10(a)(1)(b) permit

Hi Sandeep,

I just started working on the BCCP, so I will need to look into the answers to your questions.  But, the document at the link below is the latest set of infrastructure guidelines for the BCP.  It is probably the best place to start looking.

https://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/Docs/draft_plan/tier_iia-5_infrastructure_management.pdf

Have you spoken with Kimberlee Harvey at the City of Austin?  She would either have the answers to your questions or know where to find them.  Here is her contact information:

Kimberlee C. Harvey

Environmental Conservation Program Manager

Secretary of the BCCP Coordinating Committee

512-972-1686 | Kimberlee.Harvey@austintexas.gov<mailto:Kimberlee.Harvey@austintexas.gov>


Also, just to follow up a little on your last email...since the City of Austin is a permit holder of the BCCP HCP and its associated 10(a)(1)(b) permit and also the owner of the property where the road construction has taken place, I am assuming they cleared this project through the BCCP participation process within the City.  I will check more closely in their annual reports to us to see if they discuss it (and will send you a copy if I find it), but if they just did the construction, they may not report on it until this December.  That may be why I am not finding anything about it yet.

Paige

Thanks Paige.

I am going through some slide presentations where the BCCP has highlighted infra permits.
I have 2 following questions
1. IS there a minimum distance a "roadway" must have to BCCP land?
2. If yes, how much. Can you point me to the right documents for the BCCP distance requirements and exceptions if any?

Dear Katie,
Thank you for your response.

Dear Paige:
I am emailing this under FOIA and will like to share the information and get answers. The request is for parcel

The reason for writing this email was to bring to your knowledge that I have been tracking the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd (that the city of Cedar Park) did was next to BCCP land. They did *NOT* took any permissions with BCCP to construct the road. The road is now 0 cm away from the BCCP. The expansion has also impacted my property too.  I have used the BCCP tools that you have given to highlight my property. The road that runs between my property and BCCP Land had  ~25 ft distance on both sides, but now it is 0 with BCCP and that too without US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b). They also pushed the road next to my property and now it sits with just a 10 ft walkway in between.

When I inquired to City, the engineers told me(verbally) that as the land on either side of the road belongs to the city they are free to do whatever without any permits.

I am looking for a legal answer to the following question in light of this information:

      Is such major expansion without permits allowed if the other party owns land next to BCCP. Or is there a special get-away for City officials to do so?
      Have the city engineers done the changes to structure within their allowed limits when expanding the road?

My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX. I have also sent pictures of expansion and 0 distance between the road and BCCP land earlier to the official BCCP Email but have not gotten any reply.

I have also seen significantly fewer incidents of spotting wildlife and birds in and around my property which may be a result of this construction.

So to contrast what is there in actuality and what is on the BCCP site, I am sending screen shorts and links to google earth. The BCCP image shows that there is a clearance between land and road, and google earth shows 0 distance.

Hello,



Thank you for inquiring about what steps you might need to develop your site. Our program works with landowners and developers to help with Endangered Species Act compliance in western Travis County through an expedited application and certificate process under the BCCP.



The best way to do this is to submit an application to our program: https://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/Docs/application.pdf<https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.traviscountytx.gov%2Fimages%2Ftnr%2FDocs%2Fapplication.pdf&data=04%7C01%7Cpaige_najvar%40fws.gov%7C9ea5fb6093f2412169cc08d97bdcceb4%7C0693b5ba4b184d7b9341f32f400a5494%7C0%7C0%7C637677010608217043%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0&sdata=pXDHBOJzMh7po0bLiCk3wUU0iZ4FQhKEvHYRvtCig4M%3D&reserved=0>.  You can email me for guidance in filling out the application if you need to. The application is simple and the main piece of information that I need is the tax parcel ID; or survey, if it has recently been subdivided.



With information you provide, we use TCAD parcel information and the participation zone maps to provide a response back to you with the following: a habitat determination map, any conditions that may apply if you choose to participate, a quote for mitigation costs, and/or next steps and options.  You can check what habitat fee zones are within your project area using our webmap: https://arcg.is/0Pqbjb<https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farcg.is%2F0Pqbjb&data=04%7C01%7Cpaige_najvar%40fws.gov%7C9ea5fb6093f2412169cc08d97bdcceb4%7C0693b5ba4b184d7b9341f32f400a5494%7C0%7C0%7C637677010608227003%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0&sdata=k4OFj3Jf7CQvQS3Pdarhv8XkekoQUN%2BhXq1D66BuoBY%3D&reserved=0> To use the webmap, search your property using your address or TCAD ID. This map is best viewed on a Desktop computer. Or, if you prefer, you can check on the static maps showing habitat zones here: https://www.traviscountytx.gov/maps<https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.traviscountytx.gov%2Fmaps&data=04%7C01%7Cpaige_najvar%40fws.gov%7C9ea5fb6093f2412169cc08d97bdcceb4%7C0693b5ba4b184d7b9341f32f400a5494%7C0%7C0%7C637677010608227003%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0&sdata=hMMC2sBl%2BbJF4XPFpXHpTXmEzmuJT94qnt0Oqz9llNs%3D&reserved=0>.  We also use the TCAD parcel information to check to be sure that your site has not already been mitigated or paid for, through our process or a separate US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 10(a) permit.  The application and our response do not commit you to any action – this is a service we provide to help inform your options.  This part of the process – from receipt of your application to our response – typically takes 15 or fewer days. More information on the process can be found on our website.



After you receive our response letter, we encourage you to review the options and email us for any questions. If you can participate through our process (only a few sites cannot), you can notify us if you are ready to pay the mitigation and we will prepare and send a contract for you to sign; you will sign and return with your payment; we will issue the Participation Certificate to you and record with the County Clerk. The certificate goes with the property, not the person; so, if you sell the site in the future, the new landowner is covered for development within the same parcel.



You do not have to participate with us – you may apply for an ESA 10(a)(1)(B) permit through the local USFWS office by contacting  Paige Najvar at, (512) 490-0057 extension 229, or paige_najvar@fws.gov<mailto:paige_najvar@fws.gov>.  Obtaining a USFWS permit can be a lengthy process and entails developing a Habitat Conservation Plan including multiple year species surveys, a mitigation proposal, going through a public involvement process, and meeting all the permit issuance criteria.



Thanks for contacting Travis County for information. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions. I look forward to helping you find an answer to fit your needs.

Hi,



BCCP documents talk of "permits" to create and develop a structure that is more than 3000 sqft (Major structure is coined in BCCP documents as 3000 sq. ft)  near or inside BCCP land. These are covered under - US Fish and Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b)



Q(1)

If a Builder, a city, or person has land next** to BCCP, do they need permission to construct Major construction such as DAM, ROAD, Ecommerce Warehouses, etc?

Note**: The land, in this case, does not belong to BCCP but is directly attached to BCCP land i.e. distance between them is 0 ft. away from BCCP.



Q(2)

If the participation contract is NOT signed and a BCCP permit (sometimes referred to as BCCP Participation Certificate) is NOT issued, then what is the legal action that BCCP Oaths to take? Is there a section of the law that can be referred or can I be connected with a legal attorney overlooking BCCP legal in this regard?



Q(3)

Whom(Person, Email) shall I get in touch with for legal questions related to the rights of BCCP land?
