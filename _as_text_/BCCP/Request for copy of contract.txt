Filename: Hi, I live on 201 Gaspar Bend cedar Park tx.

The city of Cedar Park TX expanded the road next to my house (it is on BCCP corridor), and  I would like to get the copy of contract and permit to review their construction of expansion of Anderson Mill road that they did starting May-2017 and ended Aug-2018.  I am marking Cedar Park TX official in CC for them to officially know of this request as well.

Before you read below: Please reply all and try to keep all in loop.

Under BCCP, there must be no major construction (major = beyond 3000 sq ft) without permit (ref: Table3 of book mentioned below). Also, any construction should have maintained at least 30 feet of distance from BCCP boundary in an urban settings. I see City of Cedar Park violating all rules when they worked on the expansion project. They have left less than 1 feet distance right now between road and BCCP boundary and also messed up many things related to safety and noise prevention and many more compliances laid down by them.

In my understanding there is some relaxation to the distance rule only if the count of vehicles passing is less than 750 or else AASHTO road standards says so. I have reviewed on my end and AASHTO does not reduce the distance to mere 1 feet and the vehicle count is way way more than 750 every day. This road is now a highway and with no safety.

Given the speed at which vehicles pass day and night and the count (Well above 750 per day for sure), and the loud noise the road is producing (at nuisance level if measured) I think very soon they will destroy the habitat.
