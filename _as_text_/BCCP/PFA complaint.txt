Filename: Mr. Lance, Mr. Michael:

PFA the complaint(version 0.0.1). I think it is okay for you to first review and get back to me to let me know if I am missing more sections of violations. I can add them.

I will like to keep the closing statement as is (for the city and others). You may ignore things that do not fall under the complaint due to the limited scope of this kind of work.
