Filename: Dear Mr. Sims:

Kindly add the 2 videos to the existing proofs that I have submitted "showing that curb is not a safe enough safeguard and even a small car (leave aside huge trucks) can break past them to hit anyone who may be walking on the side of the road".

Secondly,  I also think that investigating officer(s) may need clarification on claims that I made that says that over the last 25 yrs the Licensed PE engineers may have our of *negligence* been responsible for more than 2500+ people road-deaths (I think I compared it with the count of Americans that lost life in Afghanistan in 20+ yrs there). You must additionally add the calculations that I sent the other day (email below) that show how I came to that conclusion. My basis of assumption stems right from Mr. Darwin's written email that he nor anyone he knows as PE have ever practiced calculations or estimations as defined by TBPE guidelines. They are trained to *never* bypass safety but looks like they all did. I have already submitted the email from Mr. Darwin in my original submission.

If you have the email address of the investigating officer that you can share, then I can most likely request any new requests (similar to the above 2 requests) directly to him/her.

Lastly, I want to know when can I expect some decision in this case.

I may not be that wrong when I said that I have to wait just few hours to see a violation or accident. I sent you'll an email at 12:45 today and guess what happened at 3:45 PM, an actual accident. (youtube link as you cannot visit google-drive)

Post Accident situation (Actually I saw this first, and there was a person standing so I thought it isn't urgent, but when I went there, the actual driver was all in blood, and EMS was on its way. Then I went home to pick medical supplies but EMS arrived by the time I returned with a first aid kit and water etc).

Later, looked into my recordings to see the "Accident as it happened":
VIDEO: https://youtu.be/Vu7UqJGSe7s
The curb is the only safety the city gave to me, and it means ZERO SAFETY.
The fence of BCCP is destroyed, and if it would have been a bigger truck, then wildlife is also be in danger. Coming back to my side, It could be a pedestrian's death if it happened on my side of the property. There is 0 space for them to move once such a situation happens.

Dear Mr. Sims:

I will like to know from TBPE if there is some clarification needed on my complaint (submitted on Nov-05-2021). I missed adding a section that does calculate how bad design within texas may have killed more than 3000+ Americans in the last 25+. yrs *IF* what Mr. Darwin (PE/Cedar Park) is true in saying that hundreds of Licensed PE engineers do not practice to either comply with TBPE guidelines and either does calculations/estimates themselves or make the designer companies that do them.

Basically, the calculation assumed that 5 to 10% of road fatalities are due to design issues. (Not arguing on the design cost). A rough figure says 10K lose life in texas road accidents every year, so per year, 500 to 1000 are because of the absence of design. Scale it to 25 yrs (as Mr. Darwin PE/Cedar Park) has suggested, and you get this astronomical number.  Now, even if you take 2 to 3% as a reasonable rate, then also we have lost more Texans on road due to such absence of engineering than the total we lost in the Afgan war. I have recently written the same details to the office of the president of the USA and still have to hear back from them (I may be sending a reminder there too). It is said that all this has to come from a non-engineer and no one within the engineering community stood to safeguard the very thing that makes their identity. I hope this is an eye-opener for you and others in TBPE.

Should I be calling you? How can I get proof that you have received the media successfully?

PS: Also, the flash drive will have 16 movie files (a few are QT extensions and will need Apple Quick Time to play). This is where youtube could have been a better choice.

When you get here, please come to our back door (Follow the driveway to the left around the corner of the building).  There is a doorbell that you can ring at the door and someone will come meet you to get the flash drive from you.

Mr. Sims:
Thanks for confirming. I will be down there today on or before 3:30 pm to hand over the proof to you in person.

I have already completed youtube uploads too, and one file was found duplicate and 2 files were corrupted. Also, one video was 110 MB so it is large, so I added other 3 or 4 video files that I initially did not give in the report. It does not matter if you ignore or add them to the list. I can just sit for a few hours and record more violations.

If you are ok delivering them, I think a flash drive would probably be easier for us than Youtube.  Or if they are not huge files, attaching them to an email will also work.

While the upload to youtube is getting finished, I will like to know if you still want the pictures and videos in flash drive. This property of mine is just 15-20 min away from your office and can drive to give it by hand. Is that okay with you? I can come down today at 3:30 PM. Please let me know by 2:30 PM CST Today
