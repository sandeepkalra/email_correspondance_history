Filename: Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):

Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife.  I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.

Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.

The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs.  I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations.  Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone.  I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had?  Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.

The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.

I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).

The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10.  9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).


Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Dear Sandeep,

Thank you very much for reaching out with this concern regarding road expansion activity affecting your local community.  You did in fact reach out correctly to the Office of Environmental Justice in EPA’s headquarters office.  I am putting you in touch with our EJ folks in EPA’s Region 6 office (responsible for Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma).

Gloria Vaughn is the EJ Coordinator for EPA Region 6 and Gerardo Acosta is I believe at present the manager over the EJ program in Region 6.

Sincerely,

Matthew

Subject: Re: help please - Office of Environmental Justice


sorry I sent an email too soon. I wanted to add this

There were some end-results from the communication with some teams (though not very fruitful)
[1]  BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2]  TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3]  In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.
[4]  Engineers have verbally confessed that the safety on the property is less than other 9 properties. and without commitment said If they have resources then they may try to fix things.

Dear Sir/Madam:

I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.

Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.

Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.

Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.

Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.

I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City  council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.

City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.

You all:

Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.

I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

PS:
[1] I am not a native english speaker, so pardon if there are grammar mistakes or things that you fail to understand. I will try my best to clarify again if there is something that is not clear.
[2] In 2022, President Biden is rolling out infrastructure bill and will do road expansion. I plan to raise my voice in international forums once more if the engineers and compliance people from Texas are going to join because I genuinely believe that they will not a justice to service of America.
