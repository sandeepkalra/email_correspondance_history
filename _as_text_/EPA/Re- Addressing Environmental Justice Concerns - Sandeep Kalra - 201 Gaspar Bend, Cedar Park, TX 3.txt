Filename: Mr. Chad:

what is the definition of "affected area"? Section 2.2.4 Environmental Justice is only effective for the minority population of the affected area that exceeds 50%.

The road "affected" directly to the population of 10 properties in the way it is informed to you. Out of them, 6 belong to minorities (and still are). The city themselves sent out a letter of permission seeking replacement of the picket fence to just 10 properties. Did they do it out of a noble cause or to please these 10 families? Had they seen that it affects 5 miles radius they must have done it for more than 10. Isn't it.

I do not understand how a 5-mile radius or even a 1-mile radius is considered acceptable. I do not want to end up in Kafkaesque but by the way things are defined, i can assure you that you may not have found a single violation in the last 20 years other than by someone super-rich or political powers.

9 of them were issued safety barriers that in some cases also helped reduce noise. 1 was left.

Sandeep Kalra,

I do appreciate your patience while I investigated 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX property; in conjunction, with Environmental Justice concerns regarding the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd, Cedar Park, TX. After reviewing the Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT) Community Impact Assessment Report (2015) and concerns within your email, it was determined the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not have jurisdiction at this time.

Centered on Environmental Justice regarding concerns brought forth, research into the TXDOT Community Impact Assessment Report was partitioned to focus on the City of Cedar Park, TX, then subdivided into 3 sections from the report:


  1.  Section 2.2.4 Environmental Justice
  2.  Section 3.2 Potential Displacements
  3.  Section 3.3 Community Cohesion
Section 2.2.4 Environmental Justice. The federal Council on Environmental Quality’s guidance document (see link below) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) states that “minority populations should be identified where either: (a) the minority population of the affected area exceeds 50% or (b) the minority population percentage of the affected area is meaningfully than the minority population percentage in the general population or other appropriate unit of geographic analysis.” Using current census data centered at 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX with a 1-mile radius, demographics indicate a 25% minority presence. Increasing the radius to 5-miles, using current census data, increases the minority demographic to 35% within the same area. The neighborhood surrounding 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX, does not meet the 50% minority criteria to be classified as minority neighborhood.

Section 3.2 Potential Displacements. The EPA determined displacement did not occurred due to the expansion of Anderson Mill Rd., at 201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park, TX.

Section 3.3 Community Cohesion. The EPA, using satellite imagery determined: the expansion of Anderson Mill Road did not bisect or isolate the neighborhood encompassing 201 Gaspar Bend, TX and/or surrounding homes. You may find home values for your property and others in your neighborhood by accessing property tax records via the Williamson Central Appraisal District website at https://search.wcad.org.
