Subject: Anderson Mill | Cedar Park/Williamson Co. Bond Project

Wanda,

Thank you for chatting with me today.  It was great to catch up with you, yet I'm sorry the surrounding circumstances I brought you are so dire.  As we talked about, I'm simply in need of an attorney who can provide me with solid legal counsel and inform me of my legal avenues.

To recap, a few affected neighbors and I are looking into the legalities of the Anderson Mill expansion project's impact on our properties; specifically, this relates to the road proximity - and subsequent sound levels - resulting from widening the thoroughfare to within mere feet of our fence line.

Here<http://roadbond.wilco.org/Projects/Precincts/Precinct2/P318AndersonMillRoad/tabid/5289/Default.aspx> are the published details about the project through Williamson County.

Here<http://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showdocument?id=4717> are the details (under project ID T5) from the City of Cedar Park.

Plat Map Recording Sheet<https://eagle.wilco.org/williamsonweb/document/DOCCL-2159617?search=DOCSEARCH149S1> - we are Lot 7 on page 3

Cedar Park Code of Ordinances<http://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/Z2Browser2.html?showset=cedarparkset&collection=cedarpark&documentid=78#1869> - this can easily be searched & navigated by using keyword terms.  I searched around "setbacks" and was directed to a grid of measurements, but I can't make much sense of the abbreviations used.  I searched for a legend and could not find one.

I've attached some images of our fence line, as well.  As you can see, the road is already too close for comfort; you'll also see the stakes in the ground that delineate the point to where the road will ultimately end.

Sam Roberts, the Assistant City Manager, replied today to a set of inquiries I posed to him, so I have attached that e-mail for you here.  This isn't the first round of correspondence that he & I have shared; however, what I've included here accurately represents my deep reservations about the sound, in addition to his indication of a permanent safety barrier.  While I'm grateful I was able to accomplish the latter, we must figure out a way to get a noise barrier.  As part of this effort, I have a professional acoustics consultant coming out to my house on Friday to take decibel level readings.  My expectation (and hope) is that the db levels are in violation of those set forth in the city ordinance.

Wanda, thank you so much for your help!  Let me know if you need anything more from me.

Brian
