While I am still waiting for your official reply, I thought I would help you with the viewing of the videos. For that reason I uploaded not so new videos to youtube. I would like you to confirm if these are playable at your end or not. If yes, we can start uploading more on your request. Alternately, I would like you to open a FTP server for me to upload or better ship a 16GB USB drive that I can load things and give back to you.

My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, _cedar park, tx 78613. It is at the intersection of gaspar bend and anderson mill road.
Since the last 4+ years multiple commercial 18-wheelers trucks loaded with stones, and many times with fuel, have crossed the neighborhood. Each entrance to the neighborhood has a "no pass through trucks" sign. They are not allowed in the neighborhood hence they are "unauthorized".
The video proofs are all shared links and you may open from any public computer or cell phone. If they do not work for you, I can work to upload them all to youtube for you. Does youtube work for you? There must be 25+ incidents each year, and in many cases the zoomed up picture will show the license number, etc. In all my reports, I have also mentioned the day and time. All my emails can also be uploaded to GITHUB so that they can be seen from any public computer. I have sent documents to the Williamson county legal department using github earlier.. they have not reported any issue of being unable to open. In total the proofs are in Gigabyte and cannot be shared as direct zip files.
This intersection and most of the road projects that city engineers developed in the last 30 years *was without any* safety checks. A typical truck entering and exiting the neighborhood crosses at least 50+ houses (or +/- 200 people) and at least crosses 1 elementary school connection road. A written proof from a licensed cedar park city engineer plus the cross validation of the design document can be produced if asked for (here or in court).
This makes me and my family and hundreds of more neighbors susceptible to safety risk. The local HOA and City are not acting on it. They are not open to work while holding the position that they fought for in elections and to serve..They may be purposefully hurting people if they are not acting on it and that is what it looks like to me now after chasing it for
              Page 1 of 295

  years and seeing 0 results. I will be requesting communication between HOA and City under FOIA and send you the response to FOIA once I file it with the city.
I am open to emails, have recorded zoom meetings with you, upload proofs to any public site - youtube, github, google- shared drive, etc. Please let me know what works for you.

Subject: another ranger truck spobed today
EXTERNAL email: Exercise cauMon when opening.
Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022- Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMOVYTAOaw3S3p90qO9n8iix65hzS9rw/view?usp=sharing https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AiMpwJCfoCqKmzN33ZYPC_6nwObtV6SY/view?usp=sharing

The number of appointments available each week is dependent upon the number of vaccines received from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS).
While we cannot give you an exact date of when you should expect to be contacted to schedule your appointment, we want to update you on our progress. 2/5/2021, 45,985 doses have been administered to Williamson County residents. FHS is receiving on average 8,000 vaccines each week. Because the demand for the vaccine is outpacing supply, it will take some Wme for us to work through the waitlist.
We are grateful that you are willing to take this important step to protect our community. We ask for your paWence and cooperaWon as we conWnue our vaccine operaWons over the coming months.

PFA the email thread. I am looking for 2 things:
1. In my previous appraisal meeting I raised concerns on the construction quality of the projects that Wilco is handing over to my city. I have submitted many docs at that time, and I remember one of them was showing an email that outlines a letter to me by the licensed engineer that in this city or anywhere else he has seen no safety calculations being done for any infrastructure projects. I need a copy of that submission back so that I have proof that I submitted it to Wilco. I did that in the ARB meeting, and I may have a copy but not a receipt of acknowledgement.
2. I also need answers as to why tax dollars are spent on something that cannot be produced safely. This is my reason for protest on property taxes, and I do not wish to give my tax dollars unless a written reason for it or a denial of "that never happened" kind of reason is produced.
PS: I consider myself a victim of these unsafe road projects that out of many Wilco financed.

I have raised appraisal protest on my property (201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park TX). I will need some information from you.
In the 2018 appraisal meeting at the Georgetown office, I submitted to the ARB that the city of cedar park, and many more cities in Wilco are not creating infrastructure as per guidelines provided by the safety ordinance they or texas govt. has laid down. I will need an email copy of those documents. Please provide them to me.
I have also raised my voice in city meetings, and have given them on multiple occasions written letters showing how they have misused their power and funds that Wilco has accumulated and provided them for the betterment. I have raised the same to the Texas board of engineering(TBPE). Knowing this, why has Wilco not taken any action? If wilco have taken any concrete action, then please provide proof so that I can withdraw my application to market protest or else I will go on to meet the ARB and then the head of Wilco.
If wilco cannot provide in writing why public money from me and thousands of us are misused to make unsafe and at times below quality infrastructure, then I am obliged to

0. Was the vehicle travelling with fuel or without fuel?
1. What was the Vehicle number, driver's name, driver's contact, and time when washing was done?
2. please also collect if i have to cross verify with the wash company about driver, vehicle (collect footage of the washing if possible).

I want the statement from Ranger saying "the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around" to be legally verifiable and recorded.
It will help if you can clarify "wash down Anderson Mill Road" .. is this truck cleaning service ? and at what location is this service on Anderson Mill road?

Thank you for contacWng us and bringing this maber to our abenWon. We are deeply commibed to the safety of Cedar Park residents and diligently work to keep our neighborhood roadways safe.
We have contacted Ranger about this incident and were informed that the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around. Ranger has assured us that the driver’s supervisor has instructed the driver not to uWlize Gaspar in the future.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further quesWons.

Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware
        Page 21 of 295

    of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus.

My address is 201 Gaspar Bend, _cedar park, tx 78613. It is at the intersection of gaspar bend and anderson mill road.
Since the last 4+ years multiple commercial 18-wheelers trucks loaded with stones, and many times with fuel, have crossed the neighborhood. Each entrance to the neighborhood has a "no pass through trucks" sign. They are not allowed in the neighborhood hence they are "unauthorized".
The video proofs are all shared links and you may open from any public computer or cell phone. If they do not work for you, I can work to upload them all to youtube for you. Does youtube work for you? There must be 25+ incidents each year, and in many cases the zoomed up picture will show the license number, etc. In all my reports, I have also mentioned the day and time. All my emails can also be uploaded to GITHUB so that they can be seen from any public computer. I have sent documents to the Williamson county legal department using github earlier.. they have not reported any issue of being unable to open. In total the proofs are in Gigabyte and cannot be shared as direct zip files.
This intersection and most of the road projects that city engineers developed in the last 30 years *was without any* safety checks. A typical truck entering and exiting the neighborhood crosses at least 50+ houses (or +/- 200 people) and
              Page 28 of 295

 at least crosses 1 elementary school connection road. A written proof from a licensed cedar park city engineer plus the cross validation of the design document can be produced if asked for (here or in court).
This makes me and my family and hundreds of more neighbors susceptible to safety risk. The local HOA and City are not acting on it. They are not open to work while holding the position that they fought for in elections and to serve..They may be purposefully hurting people if they are not acting on it and that is what it looks like to me now after chasing it for years and seeing 0 results. I will be requesting communication between HOA and City under FOIA and send you the response to FOIA once I file it with the city.
I am open to emails, have recorded zoom meetings with you, upload proofs to any public site - youtube, github, google- shared drive, etc. Please let me know what works for you.

The video proofs are all shared links and you may open from any public computer or cell phone. If they do not work for you, I can work to upload them all to youtube for you. Does youtube work for you? There must be 25+ incidents each year, and in many cases the zoomed up picture will show the license number, etc. In all my reports, I have also mentioned the day and time. All my emails can also be uploaded to GITHUB so that they can be seen from any public computer. I have sent documents to the Williamson county legal department using github earlier.. they have not reported any issue of being unable to open. In total the proofs are in Gigabyte and cannot be shared as direct zip files.
This intersection and most of the road projects that city engineers developed in the last 30 years *was without any* safety checks. A typical truck entering and exiting the neighborhood crosses at least 50+ houses (or +/- 200 people) and at least crosses 1 elementary school connection road. A written proof from a licensed cedar park city engineer plus the cross validation of the design document can be produced if asked for (here or in court).
This makes me and my family and hundreds of more neighbors susceptible to safety risk. The local HOA and City are not

They are not open to work while holding the position that they fought for in elections and to serve..They may be purposefully hurting people if they are not acting on it and that is what it looks like to me now after chasing it for years and seeing 0 results. I will be requesting communication between HOA and City under FOIA and send you the response to FOIA once I file it with the city.

EXTERNAL email: Exercise cauMon when opening.
Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMOVYTAOaw3S3p90qO9n8iix65hzS9rw/view?usp=sharing https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AiMpwJCfoCqKmzN33ZYPC_6nwObtV6SY/view?usp=sharing

Dear Connie Odom:
While I am still waiting for your official reply, I thought I would help you with the viewing of the videos. For that reason I uploaded not so new videos to youtube. I would like you to confirm if these are playable at your end or not. If yes, we can start uploading more on your request. Alternately, I would like you to open a FTP server for me to upload or better ship a 16GB USB drive that I can load things and give back to you.

As you can see that the truck was fuel truck and travelling less than 10m or less away from school bus in an unauthorised place, i have few questions that you must investigate and write back to reply all in this email
(and also because I do not want you and law-firm niemannlaw.com reps to find yourself gullible to lying by some small time driver of ranger company):
0. Was the vehicle travelling with fuel or without fuel?
1. What was the Vehicle number, driver's name, driver's contact, and time when washing was done?
2. please also collect if i have to cross verify with the wash company about driver, vehicle (collect footage of the washing if possible).

Mr. Jacob:
Can you confirm again with the source?
I want the statement from Ranger saying "the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around" to be legally verifiable and recorded.
It will help if you can clarify "wash down Anderson Mill Road" .. is this truck cleaning service ? and at what location is this service on Anderson Mill road?

Thanks a lot .. I appreciate the response and a quick follow up. I have always found CPPD very helpful and acting immediately as and when they can, but at the same time I understand or at least it appears that city and hoa is reluctant to help on this matter in a permanent way.
Thanks again for the excellent service.

  We have contacted Ranger about this incident and were informed that the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around. Ranger has assured us that the driver’s supervisor has instructed the driver not to uWlize Gaspar in the future.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further quesWons.

Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road- bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are
      Page 52 of 295

   holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).
Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus.

   Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper- pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here.

Thanks Mr Jacob.
Thanks a lot .. I appreciate the response and a quick follow up. I have always found CPPD very helpful and acting immediately as and when they can, but at the same time I understand or at least it appears that city and hoa is reluctant to help on this matter in a permanent way.
Thanks again for the excellent service.

Thank you for contacWng us and bringing this maber to our abenWon. We are deeply commibed to the safety of Cedar Park residents and diligently work to keep our neighborhood roadways safe.
We have contacted Ranger about this incident and were informed that the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around. Ranger has assured us that the driver’s supervisor has instructed the driver not to uWlize Gaspar in the future.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further quesWons.

Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:
When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids. I hope you all understand the gravity of the situation. These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper- pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.
I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act.

Sorry by Rds i meant ARB. I have been keeping an eye on communication to see when I can reject it but looks like it is being delayed.. so please pass this email of mine to officially reject the ARB settlement option of $400k and reschedule one with the next level i.e with Williamson county commissioner ( I guess her name is Ms. Long ).

Ok, for some reason I thought why not start good work right now.
Here is the link of all the documents I could add in a few hours. I have plenty more that I will continue to upload for all Git Repo: https://github.com/ProofsOfMiserableEnggPracticeInUSA/WiliamsonCountyKnewIt
Summary: https://github.com/ProofsOfMiserableEnggPracticeInUSA/WiliamsonCountyKnewIt/blob/main/ARB2.pdf
I do not think you are here to help me but I will still help you all.
These documents will help you all prepare and defend Wilco in the court of law.

  that time, and I remember one of them was showing an email that outlines a letter to me by the licensed engineer that in this city or anywhere else he has seen no safety calculations being done for any infrastructure projects. I need a copy of that submission back so that I have proof that I submitted it to Wilco. I did that in the ARB meeting, and I may have a copy but not a receipt of acknowledgement.
2. I also need answers as to why tax dollars are spent on something that cannot be produced safely. This is my reason for protest on property taxes, and I do not wish to give my tax dollars unless a written reason for it or a denial of "that never happened" kind of reason is produced.
PS: I consider myself a victim of these unsafe road projects that out of many Wilco financed.

     I have raised appraisal protest on my property (201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park TX). I will need some information from you.
In the 2018 appraisal meeting at the Georgetown office, I submitted to the ARB that the city of cedar park, and many more cities in Wilco are not creating infrastructure as per guidelines provided by the safety ordinance they or texas govt. has laid down. I will need an email copy of those documents. Please provide them to me.
I have also raised my voice in city meetings, and have given them on multiple occasions written letters showing how they have misused their power and funds that Wilco has accumulated and provided them for the betterment. I have raised the same to the Texas board of engineering(TBPE). Knowing this, why has Wilco not taken any action? If wilco have taken any concrete action, then please provide proof so that I can withdraw my application to market protest or else I will go on to meet the ARB and then the head of Wilco.
If wilco cannot provide in writing why public money from me and thousands of us are misused to make unsafe and at times below quality infrastructure, then I am obliged to raise this and ask them to not collect the money and instead raise this with Texas govt, that may have otherwise higher standards that they follow.
CC: roads@wilco.org if they know anything?
I will need answers.
What rights do Wilco have to misuse the money this way? I know you may not have answers. If you cannot, then please redirect the email to the right person or send

Ok, for some reason I thought why not start good work right now.
Here is the link of all the documents I could add in a few hours. I have plenty more that I will continue to upload for all Git Repo: https://github.com/ProofsOfMiserableEnggPracticeInUSA/WiliamsonCountyKnewIt
Summary: https://github.com/ProofsOfMiserableEnggPracticeInUSA/WiliamsonCountyKnewIt/blob/main/ARB2.pdf
I do not think you are here to help me but I will still help you all.
These documents will help you all prepare and defend Wilco in the court of law.

All of them are .eml extensions and need outlook or some email tools to look into.
I looked back and the date of ARB is in 2020. It is still 2 yrs back (sorry not from 2017,2018 I guess). The city of Cedar Park is known from there.. probably they also hide it from you all.
Mr. David of WCAD, who was the first to meet on my ARB appointment, was told verbally, and he did open a few attachments in the ARB meeting. Also, I submitted 100+ pages printed that I took with me and given to them for ARB as well.

I have raised appraisal protest on my property (201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park TX). I will need some information from you.
In the 2018 appraisal meeting at the Georgetown office, I submitted to the ARB that the city of cedar park, and many more cities in Wilco are not creating infrastructure as per guidelines provided by the safety ordinance they or texas govt. has laid down. I will need an email copy of those documents. Please provide them to me.
I have also raised my voice in city meetings, and have given them on multiple occasions written letters showing how they have misused their power and funds that Wilco has accumulated and provided them for the betterment. I have raised the same to the Texas board of engineering(TBPE). Knowing this, why has Wilco not taken any action? If wilco have taken any concrete action, then please provide proof so that I can withdraw my application to market protest or else I will go on to meet the ARB and then the head of Wilco.
If wilco cannot provide in writing why public money from me and thousands of us are misused to make unsafe and at times below quality infrastructure, then I am obliged to raise this and ask them to not collect the money and instead raise this with Texas govt, that may have otherwise higher standards that they follow. CC: roads@wilco.org if they know anything?
I will need answers.
What rights do Wilco have to misuse the money this way? I know you may not have answers. If you cannot, then please redirect the email to the right person or send me the email of a person or Wilco committee that may have the answers.

Hi,
Thanks for getting back to me. This is the first reponse with a conclusion and I have for some reason not received your previous response.
At this point, I will like to know that if it is not FHWA and DOT that oversights the development of public infrastructure such as roads developed by the city then which government office/institute plays that role. ?
Any pointer will be greatly appreciated.

Hi DOT.GOV:
Around 2 months back I submitted to your hotline facts and proofs explaining how many city officials in most of texas are ignoring safety and are fooling the public of the USA with fraud estimation documents.
I got directly affected by 1 project and a few city engineers but the point I raised is not limited to 1 engineer, 1 project, or 1 city. In theory, this may be going on more widespread than you may think. I am not going to judge this, but for sure history will. After all, many of these so-called "engineers" (mostly with hollow or shallow knowledge) will soon work for the US-led trillion $$ Infra project and showcase to the world how this is done.
In the last 20 yrs, this single fact may have in total killed more Americans than what this country lost in Afgan war in 20 yrs. And in the end, is there any justice to the plaintiff here?
Is there any justice for me? I will like to know if you are doing "anything" with this complaint and substance I have provided or was it just a unfortunate form-filling task that I did with a dead-end ahead of me?

Mr. Kalra,
We received this Hotline Complaint from you regarding allegaWons that the City of Cedar Park is “building roads without any safety calculaWons”. However, there was nothing to support any of the allegaWons or your claims.
What type of “safety calculaWons” are not being done by the City of Cedar Park?
[SandeepK] The city engineers, and contract firms decided to pull the road next to residents property (earlier the distance was 35ft + walkway of 7 feet, and now at some point as close as 11 feet with only safety of a 6 inch curb. City also removed 50+ yrs old trees that were also acting as protection) but did not follow PE guidelines and did "no"(none, zero) engineering safety calculation as per TBPE guidelines (Proof: https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/enf_pub.pdf, section 1001.003, 137.33 e, and lookup word "calculations") such as what kind of vehicle and what speed is safe for this kind of structure. They were supposed to use physics, and maths to do safety calculations. Instead they only did "accounting estimates" and posted them against estimates. One of the sides of the road is open to winds as it faces BCCP land and there is no structure there. YouTube is filled with videos such as these (one such Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG22JlcZnMk) that shows that high wind will make 18 wheelers fly. With no barrier, or gap between property and road except walkway a high wind can cause catastrophe to pedestrians.
I also pointed out that the 18 wheelers had in the past converted a pebble on the road as a vehicle to destroy a brand new installed fence(proof attached as screen shot). Email to city engineers showed with picture proof how a pebble from a speeding truck tore the wooden fence. There could have been a kid in that spot.
A drunk driver on a truck also is a moving missile. I hope you do not want proof of this. You can fetch thousands of reports from any police department.
Video proof of such trucks travelling unlawfully in the locality (some caring fuel). Unfortunately the angle of installation fails to capture incoming traffic and mostly capture outgoing:

This list above is not comprehensive. All the video links, time of incidents, in some cases license number etc are all with CP PD. I also have about 40+ MB of emails with videos and pictures on how all this rolled over the last 3.5 yrs. I will likely need time to compile all that if you want further proof. For proof sake i am attaching just one of the email threads. They go really long.
                 Page 122 of 295

    Page 123 of 295

  The earlier distance between walkway to road distance would have prevented any of these 3 cases. A new structure was implemented when I raised the concerns in writing (concerns.pdf, proof attached) with all these points raised. Without any safety calculations or engineering estimates (not accounting, TBPE does not give them accounting certificates!) The use of the engineering seal to lay roads is a big question mark I am raising. The engineering team further confirmed that they have been involved in such practices for the last 25+ years. I have their email in writing.
What type of studies are not being done?
[SandeepK] A safety study involving physics+math and/or estimates based on comparison study to existing similar but safe structure that was built 10 or 20 yrs with 0 problems could have helped.
On what type of roads or projects are these allegaWons being made?
[SandeepK] The road name is: Anderson Mill road. The road initially was a small 2 lane city internal road, but with start of the Anderson mill road project they have expanded the scope to make it into a major artery road (proof: roadmap copy can be asked from city, i do not have it) that helps bridge 2 or more towns (cedar park, Leander, plus other smaller localities such as jones town etc). It now connects these 2 towns to Austin Tx. The traffic numbers just a guess will be in order of 15000 to 20000 cars per day (both ways combined). There are 2 such roads now (other is Lakeline Road) but this is the only artery that allows 18 wheelers that move with 80000 ton of stone and material, quarry trucks, trucks that can carry explosives and gas tankers etc (I can give video proof for them too). These trucks are running at 65mph even when the road is set for 40 mphs. There are no speed breakers to even slow them.
Are these federal-aid projects with federal dollars?
[SandeepK] I don't know. If I have to guess, then the answer will be "no". City of Cedar Park can be contacted to find more.
What does machine regression learning have to do with safety calculaWons?
[SandeepK] There has been no study that I could find where a machine learning or regression tool has been involved to study how many accidents or road + roadside fatalities happened on such roads where licensed PE engineers did not do any calculations versus roads that had calculations done. Going by the official number that PE engineer gave me of 25+ yr of such practice. I will not be surprised if the number of fatalities from just Texas from the last 25+ yrs will give you the number of Americans dead more than how much we lost in Afghanistan in the same timeframe.
  Page 124 of 295

   What acWon do you want the City of Cedar Park or the FHWA to do with regard to these allegaWons?
[SandeepK] Few things come to my mind:
1. Fix Anderson Mill road, provide a high concrete safety-wall, + road amendments with speed reducer/breaker to avoid possible casualties. This is not just the residents of this road (Anderson mill road), but to other impacting roads such as Lakeline road.
2. Conduct Safety calculations, and if they are not as per standard, then do modifications in structure rather than lower the standards.
3. Revise the Job Description for PE engineers to explicitly spell that they cannot bypass calculations or engineering estimates. TBPE told me that they have no control over City engineers and they cannot even prosecute them even if they see wrongdoings. City must do it..
4. Make sure that the city only offers projects to contractor firms to design if and only if these safety precautions are in place.
5. Retrain staff to let them know that licensed Engineers are different from Accountants.
6. Do participate in providing data to FHWA to make a comprehensive report on how many such roads may have (or not may have) contributed to road fatalities. Do it on the whole Country scale and see how many fatalities may have been saved. I am pretty sure you will get an astonishing number.
In order for us to consider these claims, please provide any supporWng informaWon or documentaWon. Thank you,

     Hi FHWA,
I have been recommended by DOT.gov to send this info to FHWA Tx
Division instead. Please find the email with the details below. I am not sure if this comes
under the whistleblower act or not, but it is serious matter as it impacts life of a lot of Americans on the road.
I recommend you to look into the matter, and if there were no studies done, then do some to see if decisions such as these are impacting or not.

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 16:50:17 Central Standard Time
 The city engineers have been building roads without any safety calculaWons. They outsource drawings from other firms where also there are no safety calculaWons done. City engineers (Licensed and unlicensed combined) do not push the firms to do the calculaWons.
T.B.P.E (Texas Board of PE Engineers) was contacted in this respect too, but they said that they cannot rule over decisions made by city P.E. engineers. This has been happening from last 25+ years in Cedar Park. From the sense of interacWon with city and TBPE it seems not wrong to assume that this has been pracWce in a lot texas ciWes. (Cannot say for sure for other ciWes - but they were not surprised by the learnings). On asking for calculaWons, city provided me with what Engineers has been submiång as "calculaWons" and "esWmates" and it was actually "accounWng calculaWons". Cedar Park TX is just 20 miles from AusWn capital. You can extrapolate to see what is the level of engineering fraud going on.
All data menWoned by me above here is backed by FOIA, and wriben communicaWon with TBPE, Cedar Park City Council, Cedar Park City Engineers. I can present my data if needed. More so, the cedar park city has not indicated to me that they will take any acWon w.r.t this.
I as a student am also interested in running Machine learning regression algo. to find the correlaWon but could not find dataset on your website NHSTA w.r.t. any accident studies done where the correlaWon to this parameters were studied. I will equally be interested in finding the data to run models myself (if anything or this sort was collected earlier). In case there is data available, then i will like to see that data.

Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last
25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
             Page 138 of 295

   The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

sorry I sent an email too soon. I wanted to add this
There were some end-results from the communication with some teams (though not very fruitful)
[1] BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2] TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3] In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.
[4] Engineers have verbally confessed that the safety on the property is less than other 9 properties. and without commitment said If they have resources then they may try to fix things.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the
   Page 142 of 295

      concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20A
ssessment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.

Thanks for the clarificaWon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
          The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have
 Page 147 of 295

     violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayWme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighåme: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.

this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoWce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient. -- Decision --
               Page 152 of 295

-- Decision --
       We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricMons to enter our property sMll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecWvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raMonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaWon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepWng the deal of just a higher (addiWonal 2 |) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriWng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bubercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acWon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraWon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuWon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opWons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 | wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaWon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriWng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 | wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriWng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 | wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 | at the roadside.
 Page 153 of 295

       [ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beber to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaWons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiWonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 | wooden fence only a|er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15|) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaWons when we met the city for the first Wme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is abached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecWon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaWonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenWal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaMons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Mme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaWons based on models developed using mathemaWcs, science and past experiences from similar
situaWons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluWon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properWes in the similar situaWon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe
journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard
 Page 154 of 295

       land that I le| as an easement for uWlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiMonal 2 h high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 | wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 | away from the road with no protecWon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 |. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaWonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind
enough to not see the 3-4 | barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 | high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiång the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeWng with details) that they will give at least 3 | barrier and retenWon wall to all properWes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesWon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unWl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secWons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaWons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepWng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusWn-City to give part of the land that AusWn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a
 Page 155 of 295

They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a
       wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let
us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 | margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 |. Max distance is 9 | from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeMng point: Min is 9 |, and the Max distance is at 10 | from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 |. Farthest is 20+ |.

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight,
etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
           Page 159 of 295

  The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety
   Page 162 of 295

     barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.

     You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Asse
ssment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

Thanks for the clarificaWon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.

  I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?

This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or abached to the motor vehicle.
o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Wres on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaWons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
I am not a legal expert and I will try geång legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.

The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayWme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighåme: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be
      Page 167 of 295

    unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this
property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a
masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.

No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here.

Subject: Re: NoWce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient. -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricMons to enter our property sMll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecWvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raMonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaWon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepWng the deal of just a higher (addiWonal 2 |) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriWng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bubercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acWon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraWon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuWon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opWons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 | wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaWon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriWng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line
          Page 171 of 295

      or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 | wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriWng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 | wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 | at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beber to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaWons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiWonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 | wooden fence only a|er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15|) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaWons when we met the city for the first Wme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is abached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecWon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaWonale --
 Page 172 of 295

      Property sits at a point where a potenWal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculaMons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Mme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaWons based on models developed using mathemaWcs, science and past experiences from similar situaWons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluWon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properWes in the similar situaWon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le| as an easement for uWlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiMonal 2 h high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 | wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 | away from the road with no protecWon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 |. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaWonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 | barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 | high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiång the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeWng with details) that they will give at least 3 | barrier and retenWon wall to all properWes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesWon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unWl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference
 Page 173 of 295

      to exact secWons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaWons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepWng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusWn-City to give part of the land that AusWn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 | margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 |. Max distance is 9 | from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeMng point: Min is 9 |, and the Max distance is at 10 | from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 |. Farthest is 20+ |.

Dear Ms. Gloria,
It will be kind of you if you can help me by arranging possible tesWng for environmental studies on my property to find out levels of pollutants and noise etc. as i have not been able to convince any other party(city, engineers, or compliance) to even answer the request.

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to
the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk
away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to
          Page 177 of 295

 protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the
   Page 180 of 295

    project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Assess
ment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of
   Page 181 of 295

    minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayWme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighåme: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
     Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of
 Page 185 of 295

   tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
               Page 186 of 295

 You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoWce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
                  Page 188 of 295

     -- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restricMons to enter our property sMll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecWvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the raMonale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaWon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepWng the deal of just a higher (addiWonal 2 |) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriWng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bubercup creek, Cedar Park, TX)
and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acWon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraWon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuWon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opWons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 | wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaWon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriWng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 | wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriWng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 | wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier
 of 3 | at the roadside.
Page 189 of 295

     of 3 | at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything beber to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaWons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiWonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 | wooden fence only a|er making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15|) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaWons when we met the city for the first Wme in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is abached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecWon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaWonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenWal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple speculaMons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all Mme etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaWons based on models developed using mathemaWcs, science and past experiences from similar situaWons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluWon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properWes in the similar situaWon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I le| as an easement for uWlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addiMonal 2 h high wood
 Page 190 of 295

     fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 | wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 | away from the road with no protecWon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 |. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaWonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 | barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 | high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hiång the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeWng with details) that they will give at least 3 | barrier and retenWon wall to all properWes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesWon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unWl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secWons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaWons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepWng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusWn-City to give part of the land that AusWn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident
 Page 191 of 295

it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident
     with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 | margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 |. Max distance is 9 | from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeMng point: Min is 9 |, and the Max distance is at 10 | from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 |. Farthest is 20+ |.

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing
fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the
                Page 195 of 295

readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low- income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
   Page 198 of 295

   Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.

Noise Complaints from Anderson Mill Rd..eml.eml, No9ce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything.eml.eml
Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing
fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low- income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area
        Page 201 of 295

to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Dear Mr. Lance.
I am wriWng to you to request an in-person representaWon of TBPE in a fully recorded meeWng that I have requested for the Cedar Park City Engineers and management.
Mr. Darwin Marchell, P.E. has shared the following link about specificaWons on Aug-01-2018.
hbp://www.dot.state.tx.us/apps-cg/specs/SearchForm.asp?type=7
I am pasWng an excerpt from the spec on this link:
"Design Calculations. Include calculations covering the range of heights and loading conditions on the project.
Calculations for both internal and external stability as described on the plans will be required. Include a summary of all
design parameters used; material types, strength values, and assumed allowable; loads and loading combinations; and factor-
of-safety parameters."
AND, at the same Wme, I have this email(attached as PDF, because of the email history) where Mr. Darwin who is represenWng the city engineers is trying to tell me that calculaWons are business-calculaWons and that is how the city has operated from last 20+ years.
Mr. Sam Roberts, P.E. has come forward to clarify my doubts about the noise and polluWon that the structure is now producing was never a responsibility of the city even when written concerns were given to them before the work started, and I may need some assistance from TBPE to cross-examine the facts as and when they are presented to me in the meeWng.
I am hoping that TBPE will accept the request for joining the meeWng.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayWme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
     Page 211 of 295

(2) Nighåme: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
     The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

Dear Robert, Kevin and Amber.
You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
Acoustic Beamforming: Mapping Sources of Truck Noise , link: https://books.google.com/books? id=rDyhc7WhqqIC&pg=PA7&dq=argument+motor+vehicle+motor+sound+is+not+motor+vehicle+tyre+sound&hl=e n&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2uMbW9evmAhUZCs0KHZ9cCjQQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=onepag e&q=argument%20motor%20vehicle%20motor%20sound%20is%20not%20motor%20vehicle%20tyre%20sound&f =false

I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.
There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).
Ref : Table 3 of book, and AASHTO std is already with you to guide.
https://books.google.com/books?id=cTc3AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA6-PA1&lpg=RA6- PA1&dq=BCCP+Infrastructure+Corridors&source=bl&ots=_Eo3sbzQOK&sig=ACfU3U0A- yfjuqfmPKHpOlkEV1gbKalGdA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi49ciP4ebmAhWJGs0KHYrLANkQ6AEwBnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q= BCCP%20Infrastructure%20Corridors&f=false
I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this.
Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below
Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
   Page 217 of 295

     Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
 Page 218 of 295

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 16:50:26 Central Standard Time
 Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

            Page 228 of 295

  Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).

      Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

   Dear Robert, Kevin and Amber.
You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
Acoustic Beamforming: Mapping Sources of Truck Noise , link: https://books.google.com/books? id=rDyhc7WhqqIC&pg=PA7&dq=argument+motor+vehicle+motor+sound+is+not+motor+vehicle+tyre+sound& hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2uMbW9evmAhUZCs0KHZ9cCjQQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v =onepage&q=argument%20motor%20vehicle%20motor%20sound%20is%20not%20motor%20vehicle%20tyr e%20sound&f=false

I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.
There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).

- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).
Ref : Table 3 of book, and AASHTO std is already with you to guide.

I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this. Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
                Page 243 of 295

  - does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

      those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then
 Page 246 of 295

that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then
      please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).

I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this. Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
                Page 257 of 295

   - does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?

Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
    Page 263 of 295

 I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
Acoustic Beamforming: Mapping Sources of Truck Noise , link: https://books.google.com/books? id=rDyhc7WhqqIC&pg=PA7&dq=argument+motor+vehicle+motor+sound+is+not+motor+vehicle+tyre+sound&hl =en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2uMbW9evmAhUZCs0KHZ9cCjQQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=on epage&q=argument%20motor%20vehicle%20motor%20sound%20is%20not%20motor%20vehicle%20tyre%20s ound&f=false

Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
                  Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the
 city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the

      city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
 Page 273 of 295

      Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.
Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.
Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.
Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

FYI. All. Happy New Year 2020. Today we started geång first retaliaWon post from engineering team of cedar park as they think I fooled them in asking for their procedure and working and then found them red handed doing things wrong. RetaliaWon is never a good idea and we will reply to our best capacity. It’s a good news as it shows something has started working with us in 2020.

I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.
There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).

I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this.
Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
- does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Dear Robert, Kevin and Amber.
You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
Acoustic Beamforming: Mapping Sources of Truck Noise , link: https://books.google.com/books? id=rDyhc7WhqqIC&pg=PA7&dq=argument+motor+vehicle+motor+sound+is+not+motor+vehicle+tyre+sound&hl=e n&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2uMbW9evmAhUZCs0KHZ9cCjQQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=onepag

      Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.

Hi,
I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.
There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.
I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.
The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).
Ref : Table 3 of book, and AASHTO std is already with you to guide.
https://books.google.com/books?id=cTc3AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA6-PA1&lpg=RA6- PA1&dq=BCCP+Infrastructure+Corridors&source=bl&ots=_Eo3sbzQOK&sig=ACfU3U0A- yfjuqfmPKHpOlkEV1gbKalGdA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi49ciP4ebmAhWJGs0KHYrLANkQ6AEwBnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=BC CP%20Infrastructure%20Corridors&f=false
I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov) to notify them for further escalation on this.
Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.
        Page 288 of 295

 Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term. - does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.
I request again to the city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

I will be marking few Local news media in CC now onwards (they are now in CC). Some international news media has also expressed interest in covering the news but I will only go to them if the City continue to not follow their own ordinances and do not take enough actions even after the writing them for years.

Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below
Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:
Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max" time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering

    department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?
Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
Were there any meeting records, emails to show that there was any line of action thought to address the concerns?
Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
structure is safe or will be safe? Were there any design modifications to
metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and pedestrians?
Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).
Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.

Wanda,
Thank you for chatting with me today. It was great to catch up with you, yet I'm sorry the surrounding circumstances I brought you are so dire. As we talked about, I'm simply in need of an attorney who can provide me with solid legal counsel and inform me of my legal avenues.
To recap, a few affected neighbors and I are looking into the legalities of the Anderson Mill expansion project's impact on our properties; specifically, this relates to the road proximity - and subsequent sound levels - resulting from widening the thoroughfare to within mere feet of our fence line.
Here are the published details about the project through Williamson County. Here are the details (under project ID T5) from the City of Cedar Park.

  Plat Map Recording Sheet - we are Lot 7 on page 3
 Cedar Park Code of Ordinances - this can easily be searched & navigated by using keyword terms. I searched around "setbacks" and was directed to a grid of measurements, but I can't make much sense of the abbreviations used. I searched for a legend and could not find one.
I've attached some images of our fence line, as well. As you can see, the road is already too close for comfort; you'll also see the stakes in the ground that delineate the point to where the road will ultimately end.
Sam Roberts, the Assistant City Manager, replied today to a set of inquiries I posed to him, so I have attached that e-mail for you here. This isn't the first round of correspondence that he & I have shared; however, what I've included here accurately represents my deep reservations about the sound, in addition to his indication of a permanent safety barrier. While I'm grateful I was able to accomplish the latter, we must figure out a way to get a noise barrier. As part of this effort, I have a professional acoustics consultant coming out to my house on Friday to take decibel level readings. My expectation (and hope) is that the db levels are in violation of those set forth in the city ordinance.
Wanda, thank you so much for your help! Let me know if you need anything more from me. Brian
