Ok, for some reason I thought why not start good work right now.

Here is the link of all the documents I could add in a few hours. I have plenty more that I will continue to upload for all
Git Repo:  https://github.com/ProofsOfMiserableEnggPracticeInUSA/WiliamsonCountyKnewIt
Summary: https://github.com/ProofsOfMiserableEnggPracticeInUSA/WiliamsonCountyKnewIt/blob/main/ARB2.pdf

I do not think you are here to help me but I will still help you all.
These documents will help you all prepare and defend Wilco in the court of law.

Thank you for your response.

I see that finding documents of this nature has been difficult for all departments of Wilco and City of Cedar Park, so I have decided to openly share them on github so that no one finds it difficult to refer to them. I will be doing my best to list things and over the next few weeks help others ask the same questions as I am doing.

Subject: Fwd: FOIA Wilco Records needed.

PFA the email thread. I am looking for 2 things:

1. In my previous appraisal meeting I raised concerns on the construction quality of the projects that Wilco is handing over to my city. I have submitted many docs at that time, and I remember one of them was showing an email that outlines a letter to me by the licensed engineer that in this city or anywhere else he has seen no safety calculations being done for any infrastructure projects. I need a copy of that submission back so that I have proof that I submitted it to Wilco. I did that in the ARB meeting, and I may have a copy but not a receipt of acknowledgement.

2. I also need answers as to why tax dollars are spent on something that cannot be produced safely. This is my reason for protest on property taxes, and I do not wish to give my tax dollars unless a written reason for it or a denial of "that never happened" kind of reason is produced.

PS: I consider myself a victim of these unsafe road projects that out of many Wilco financed.

________________________________

I have raised appraisal protest on my property (201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park TX). I will need some information from you.

In the 2018 appraisal meeting at the Georgetown office, I submitted to the ARB that the city of cedar park, and many more cities in Wilco are not creating infrastructure as per guidelines provided by the safety ordinance they or texas govt. has laid down. I will need an email copy of those documents. Please provide them to me.

I have also raised my voice in city meetings, and have given them on multiple occasions written letters showing how they have misused their power and funds that Wilco has accumulated and provided them for the betterment. I have raised the same to the Texas board of engineering(TBPE).  Knowing this, why has Wilco not taken any action? If wilco have taken any concrete action, then please provide proof so that I can withdraw my application to market protest or else I will go on to meet the ARB and then the head of Wilco.

If wilco cannot provide in writing why public money from me and thousands of us are misused to make unsafe and at times below quality infrastructure, then I am obliged to raise this and ask them to not collect the money and instead raise this with Texas govt, that may have otherwise higher standards that they follow. CC: roads@wilco.org<mailto:roads@wilco.org> if they know anything?


I will need answers.


What rights do Wilco have to misuse the money this way? I know you may not have answers. If you cannot, then please redirect the email to the right person or send me the email of a person or Wilco committee that may have the answers.
