Filename: Thanks Mr Jacob.

Thanks a lot .. I appreciate the response and a quick follow up. I have always found CPPD very helpful
and acting immediately as and when they can, but at the same time I understand or at least it appears
that city and hoa is reluctant to help on this matter in a permanent way.

Thanks again for the excellent service.

Hello Sandeep,

Thank you for contacting us and bringing this matter to our attention. We are deeply committed to the safety of Cedar Park residents and diligently work to keep our neighborhood roadways safe.

We have contacted Ranger about this incident and were informed that the driver of the Ranger truck was traveling to wash down Anderson Mill Road and mistakenly turned onto Gaspar Bend to turn around. Ranger has assured us that the driverâ€™s supervisor has instructed the driver not to utilize Gaspar in the future.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Jacob

Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:

When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids.  I  hope you all understand the gravity of the situation.  These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.

I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).

Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus.
