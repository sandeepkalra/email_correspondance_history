Filename: Thanks Mr. Robins. Do you recommend counting lawyers or is this something that court can hear directly from property owners? I will like to understand that process and it will be really helpful if you can forward me links to the details
Best Regards

Good afternoon,

There are additional opportunities to protest the market value that include binding arbitration and lawsuit.   You will get a letter in the mail from the ARB that describes the steps that you can take to exercise one of these options.  There are time limits as to when these options can be started, but the time limits start from when the letter is mailed and not from the time that the hearing is completed.  If you have questions or concerns after receiving the letter, please reach out to me here.

Sincerely,

I would like to officially REJECT ARBs final decision on my protest. I do NOT agree with the $640k evaluation put forward by the ARB Committee.  Please let me know what are the next steps and I am ok if this is something like going to Williamson county court or other legal entity.
