Filename: I would like to officially REJECT ARBs final decision on my protest. I do NOT agree with the $640k evaluation put forward by the ARB Committee.  Please let me know what are the next steps and I am ok if this is something like going to Williamson county court or other legal entity.

Hi,

I will like to officially REJECT ARBs final decision on my protest. I do agree to $640k evaluation.  Please let me know what are the next steps and I am ok if this is something like going to Williamson county court or Supreme Court.
