Filename: I have been asking for protection from pollution, safety, and genuine living standards for the last 5 yrs. I think CP treats their people far worse than Austin cities treat their animal shelters, and or bird sanctuaries. This is my last email to city engineers who may or may not work on my request. I am simply forwarding it to you as you are the legal guardian of the city at this moment.

Please save this email below for the city's own records.

Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra

I met with you all-around 1.5 yrs back (Feb-14-2020) when you said that you will take care of safety. I understand that things have delayed due to Covid. I have not raised the issue as I agreed till now. I will like this to now be closed by end of November-31st 2021. It is the last I will wait.

Best Regards,
