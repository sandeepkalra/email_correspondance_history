Filename: Hi HOA Board:

I requested you to write to the City on Aug-24-2022.  Have you given in writing the concerns of the people of Buttercup creek to Cedar Park City?
Can you please send me proof that you have done so?

Here is one truck today(Oct-04-2022): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPaNjeytHNnIpMsTSblggkizoGh896Di/view?usp=sharing
This is 18 wheeler Ranger Truck loaded with rocks. A small accident from this truck is enough to kill any resident on the spot.

Another incident: 2 weeks back a truck that passed our neighborhood dropped pebbles on the way. The stones are spread all through Gaspar bend, Steven Ct., Lauren Trail, and Nelson loop (and may be more places in the neighborhood). The stones are still lying on the road and no one is cleaning them. Look around, especially the curves where the truck took turns *such as the intersection of Anderson mill and Gaspar, intersection of Gaspar and Steven Ct,  etc.

One such pebble has once caused serious damage to my fence as a speeding car just converted it to a projectile. The fense tore by the impact, and you can still visit to see the damage. This was in 2017 or 2018 and even after writing (with photo proof) to city engineers, and no-one showed up. I am still waiting here (year 2022). Imagine some person standing and got hit by that stone.
I think that the Cedar Park City and This HOA must exchange some mails/emails through their lawyers to finalize 'who will be liable' if these incidents carry on and one day cause a loss of life or even cause an accident.  Will the city pay or HOA will pay to the person impacted. Do let me know if either party needs proof that these incidents happened or not. I will help to my fullest with the recordings.

Sandeep Kalra

HOA Board:

Not sure if some neighbor has started major renovation or this is just routine traffic passing through without permissions. I request you to kindly provide safety measures and take it with the city (keep things in writing of-course).
