All: I am a bit sick, and still cannot reply as promptly as I was doing in past. I am pasting the email that I got( with only selective people in CC) from president of HOA, with my reply to it:

Sara:
 a) Why this email now?  This email from HOA is 2.5 yrs late.
 I have lost confidence in HOA. To gain my confidence, please reply to question-b of this email

 b) The residents were all were at your monthly HOA meeting inn May-2017 raising the concerns. HOA was there on the day (May-22,2017) when the city called for meeting.  I read the whole concerns.pdf document that I also emailed to city. For period of May-2017 and Oct-2019:
Where are the proofs that HOA worked for safety , security, health and welfare of residents   if you or anyone in HOA worked and fought for my rights then I will feel confident that you all will represent the owners correctly. When and with Whom did you (or anyone in HOA) interacted with in city to raise concern of the residents? Where is the email chain, or mail, or any record to prove.

 c) the concern document is shared with many in HOA and City. Nothing has changed from my side.
 They were delivered in written format, and I can clarify if the English isn't clear (I am not a native English speaker)

Also, it will be great if you can show the meeting-dispositions and conclusions from May-2017 when all residents showed up and mentioned of these concerns, any other meeting-disposition and conclusions with City of Cedar Park where you all have taken these agendas, or any internal meeting-disposition where you have decided anything affirmatively to tackle these concerns.

This is specifically to you

You (or may be Celeste, or someone else) was in HOA office the day city decided to expand the road. Me and about 7+ neighbors showed up in HOA meeting(Around may-26th-2017) and to raise concern (Safety, Noise, Pollution, nuisance were all discussed). The HOA reps were there in city hall also when I read loudly my concerns (PDF version is still on google drive). No affirmative email or formal communication was done or is done till date by HOA to the city to raise the concerns of us.

The HOA did nothing when it came to concerns for us residents for the safety, noise and security.  Show me what you all did for the concerns before I can understand why I must respect HOA? Show me email/mail/disposition of meeting on taking affirmative action to the concern. Where does your duty lies?

I understand that I will be asking for 10 ft wall and more so, 10 linear ft extension to what the current fence line is ... and that is nowhere near what the HOA has in requirements, and chance are high for rejection, but let me bring it out loud and clear -- if you all cannot take these concerns and just do what paper-pushers do, then you'll are nothing but decorated clerks / peons.. and I better highlight this to world too.

What is use of sending notice for grass not cut, or vegetation not looking good, The city came and destroyed the habitat, made my family insecure and running out. Why shall you all be in job when a 5th grader can also see and send notice of lawn mowing, clear funds for pool cleaning and collect funds and survive in day-job.

Sandeep,

Just to clarify, I told you that you would need approval from the HOA for any modifications to the fence.  I did not say the City has no role in this.  The City may or may not have regulations or require permits to build.  That is something you will need to find out.   I can speak to the HOA requirements but cannot speak to any City requirements.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Jim,
My reply to you on your email (pasted from 1:1 email that you sent me) will shortly be on this thread. For now, I have general yet important message for City and HOA. Please go with this to your bosses and let them know.


Reps of City Of Cedar Park:
It's been more than 8 days since my first email asking for procedures to abide to your rule. There is around 7 days left before I will assume that you all have nothing to do with the conversion and extension of fence to wall on my property. The HOA rep (earlier to Jim) back on day when I was pleading to not make this lame fence and rather give a wall, wrote email saying that HOA has nothing to do with the part facing Anderson mill road, and city is solely responsible. Now, I was told on phone by Jim (HOA rep) that ONLY hoa is responsible for taking any decision for this matter, and city has no role in any decision making. I want to confirm if that is the case. I do not know people inside City to guide but you all must know, and/or can find out easily. You still have till November 15th-2019 to affirmatively respond and let me know that city allso has some bureaucratic procedures that I have to address to make my life better than hell.


General for HOA, CITY and Others in CC:
With my future responses  you will start seeing some journalists, reporters of leading national newspapers from USA, China, and India in CC to this email chain. Do not be surprised !!
I think everyone has rights to know how hollow the engineering practices are here in Cedar Park and probably whole of Texas, how bureaucratic hoa and restrictive living is in where one has to go from pillar to post just to get safety and security of his own family for something they did not invent, and how it reminds them of some 3rd world country that does nothing for the welfare of residents, but only works for money makers, powerful, and upper class.

Till date, city failed to give me any calculations to show that the roads were made in safe manner, they failed to show enough data otherwise (comp data of at least 40-50 properties in and around with same situation) to proof that this has been working for others, no recordings of noise levels, nothing.

Again, please do not do 1:1.. I know we all are guilty of doing it..but let's try to do avoid it.

Hi Sandeep,

You can propose a higher fence, but if it does not meet the hoa requirements it would most likely be denied.  I would encourage you to work within the hoa guidelines.  If you cannot, please provide as much detail as possible for the committee to review.

Jim, The paperwork from HOA that you want me to fill DOES NOT MEET my family's SAFETY and SECURITY needs. The paperwork is limiting to 6 ft fence.. and I do want higher. Does that mean I CANNOT propose a Higher fence?

I will sign with the assumption that it is a minimum of 8 ft high... even if paperwork says otherwise. I WILL MENTION this in the application too.

All,
Sorry for a bit back and forth. I have revised the design (not a lot).

New design attached - [fence-design-201gaspar.new.1.pdf].

What has changed from the previous design - I have removed absolute numbers, and made them x,y as I wasn't sure if the readings are correct. Removed timeframe because I am not sure I can secure enough in 1 year to do it. Besides these - I added a fence door to access my back property, as I and my family are living in fear to even visit it because the way to reach it need to access side road of Anderson Mill road and it is without any barrier to protect the pedestrians (God please save those who risk doing it).

I am still not sure if city and hoa need paperwork and money from me to consider the new design or I can start on Nov-15th? As I said earlier, Reply-all here to let me and others know what all I have to go though and show that you are the big bosses and you control lives by means of forms, fees for something that is a result of 'your' misdoings. (do not reach me 1:1).

When you review my case, think twice on these points before deciding:
- SAFETY
- AIR POLLUTION
- NOISE
- THE CITY OF AUSTIN did not allowed cedar park to share/use even 10-to-20 ft of their land to expand Anderson Mill road because they wanted to protect the birds and animal life.. At least CITY of AUSTIN seems to have higher value for vegetation, animals and birds than the city of cedar park has for tax paying humans (leave aside plans, animals).
-  You'll already know this: I have been actively marking these email to local news channels(Jody from KXAN is in CC in all my emails here). and I will start reaching to National and International media, social media and forums etc. Today they may have somewhat different view of "American Standards and Life" here than the HOLLOW STANDARDS and HELL LIFE I and my family experienced (and probably all pedestrians do too).

(I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).

And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.

You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs in GOOGLE LINK as attachment did not work  - just to show pollution)


I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is  what the two looks like today morning.

Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.

So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.

Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...

No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: Notice of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything

We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.

-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restrictions to enter our property still exists.

I and my wife(called "we") has collectively decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the rationale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situation at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepting the deal of just a higher (additional 2 ft) wood fence to what we have now.

We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a writing a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of buttercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next action will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.

We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustration, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execution of this project.

-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 options/plans given below.

[ Plan 1 ]  We will accept the 8 ft wooden fence if the City does the complete calculation for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in writing that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).

[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ft wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in writing a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.

[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ft wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ft at the roadside.

[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything better to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculations and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 additional PE engineers appointed by City.  In this case, we will accept the 8 ft wooden fence only after making sure that the plan is safe.

Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.

-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall.  The size(15ft) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendations when we met the city for the first time in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is attached.  The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspection.

We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.

-- Rationale --
Property sits at a point where a potential 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculations such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all time etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No Calculations based on models developed using mathematics, science and past experiences from similar situations. No Noise control. No trees. No pollution checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properties in the similar situation in whole Cedar Park.  This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I left as an easement for utility lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an additional 2 ft high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ft wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.

My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ft away from the road with no protection. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 ft. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.

Add-ons Rationales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ft barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ft high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hitting the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeting with details) that they will give at least 3 ft barrier and retention wall to all properties, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will question them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences until they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact sections per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculations.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepting whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade Austin-City to give part of the land that Austin uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
        They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard,  so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.


-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ft margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard:  Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 ft. Max distance is 9 ft from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeting point: Min is 9 ft, and the Max distance is at 10 ft from the property line.
Back Yard:  Min is 11 ft. Farthest is 20+ ft.

I am coming this weekend there in cedar Park house to personally evaluate the situation and then I will let you know.

BTW, initial email from you saying if one property owner do not agree then it will be a 'no' to all. How is it that possible that you now want to give others a fence but okay if I walk out?

Sandeep:
I am following up on the email below.  Since the fence construction is about to start sometime next week, I just wanted to check and see if the right-of-entry withdrawal is still in effect.  The fence contractor will only be out there for about a week and if you want your fence reconstructed, he needs to complete this work while he is out there.  We won’t be paying an additional mobilization fee for the contractor to come back out there after he finished the other sections of fence.

Thanks,
Alan
