Hi Mrs. LeAnn:

I have to get the following request.
- If someone has to sue the city in court, then what is the *address of the city of cedar park administration* that it must use, and whom shall things be addressed to?

1. The name of HOA is ‘westside HOA’.
2. I do not know names of all board members but the leadership is with Mr Denny (denney.james@westsidehoa.org<mailto:denney.james@westsidehoa.org>). All I can say is that the official email address has WestsideHOA.org in their email. So, anything coming from them raising concerns and proposed actions on safety issues etc.
3. Timeframe is Jan-01-2022 till Nov-01-2022(both end date included)
Feel free to email me if this is still not clear
Best regards

Good Morning,

In relation to your Public Information Request received by electronic mail on  November 8, 2022, the City will need additional clarification in order to continue processing your request.

Please clarify and provide:

1.       The name of the Homeowner’s Association you are referencing.

2.       The Board Member names.

a.       HOA’s are not required to register with the City, therefore we have no record that would identify Board Members by name.

3.       A timeframe for which you are seeking with a beginning and an ending date.



By providing the above information, this will assist the City with searching for any responsive doucments you are seeking.



Thank you.

Dear Mrs. LeAnn:

I have raised numerous safety concerns to the city of cedar park and to my hoa (buttercup creek) for incoming 18 wheelers passing through with stones, and fuel. I have also requested my HOA to publicly and legally ask the city to work on all such incidents.

With this email, I would like to request you under FOIA to kindly provide me with any/all Requests and concerns that my HOA board or Board members may have asked in writing (or anything legally accepted in court) to the city of cedar park or vice-versa (i.e. from city to HOA) so as to help with increasing safety violations. To narrow down you search please I am okay with only last 10 months of communication (i.e. Jan-1-2022 till Nov-1-2022).


Also, If you can compile that - If there are such requests made, then what departments worked on it, and what were the actions taken (temporary ones and the permanent ones)

I am also marking CC to JP.LeCompte as they may have worked on any legal requests that were passed by my HOA or their representatives (including board members, lawyers office etc).

Will appreciate the response from you or Mr. JP LeCompte.
