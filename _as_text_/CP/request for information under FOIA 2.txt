Filename: Dear WBC board members:

I have numerous times raised safety concerns due to 18-wheelers and fuel tankers passing through the neighborhood. Safety is my right and you are there to protect me. I have asked this board to act on many occasions and have copied almost all incidents that I have reported, and I have specifically asked this board to raise in writing to the city so that a legal case can be pre prepared. I have asked the reply to this request 2 times in last 2+ months, and after waiting for 2 months I am bound to ask the same using FOIA.

I have some questions and I need the answers. This request is made under FOIA:
[1]- was there any legal request made by this board or board members during the period of jan-01-2022 till nov-01-2022 that raised the same concerns to the cedar park city.
[2]- was there any legal request made by the city to the board and/or members, during the same period to act on the concerns of the residents of the neighborhood?
[3]- in the case of [1] or [2], was there any action taken by this board?


Please let me know the response in some reasonable days.

Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra
