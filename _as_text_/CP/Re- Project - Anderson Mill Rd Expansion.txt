What do you think of this email below?
It is not just 1 PE's situation on the ground, but pick any so-called engineer, or, staff at my city.

Measure 2 times, cut 1 time is Engineering 101.
Here it's 0 measurements, and only (short-)cuts left and right.

Sandeep,
I have been doing this for 25 years and am a registered professional engineer.  I am 100% certain that the estimate relates to the cost of the project.  What field of engineering is your wife registered as a professional engineer in?

I think you are mistaken on the estimate part.
The context of the clause is on safety, and welfare and I believe the estimates are also associated to the safety and not to cost.

The state or a political subdivision of the state may not construct a public work involving engineering in which the public h
ealth, welfare,
or safety is involved, unless:
(1) th
e engineering plans, specifications, and estimates have been prepared by an engineer; and
(2) the engineering construction is to be performed under the direct supervision of an engineer

Section 1001.407 TBPE Guide for any license engineer working on "Public Work" must support his work with 3 parts (a) Plan (b) Specifications and (3) Estimates.
I am asking for the (b) and (c). They must be in your possession from the person who sealed the design plan.

Am I wrong in assuming that licensed engineers have to abide to the TBPE Rule guide?

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you mention below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane.  As I mentioned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are decelerating.
Second, we have not lied, hidden information or misled you in any way.  In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.   The handrail is not located on the property line.  There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk.  The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot sitting right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated.  These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculations you are looking for.  The roadway cross sections can be found in the City of Austin’s Transportation Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted.  The cross sections and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials) design manual.  This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Darwin

Alan, Darwin,

When I talked to you and others in first meeting at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ ft distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other location... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumatized us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).

There is a 12 ft sitting right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

I am not buying your speculations and assumptions and speculation about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculations that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situation will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?

If I find flaw in calculations or no calculations to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporting this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's mentioned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Deepshikha:
Attached are the requested plan sheets.  For your information when looking at these plan sheets, the turn lane has been reduced from 12 feet to 11 feet wide and this change is not depicted.  I will be in the field at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning to measure and I have requested that the contractor and our inspector be present as well.

Thanks,

Darwin,

Are you available for coming down to the property and show us the 11 ft distance that you talked about? Also, Please send a copy of the drawings (or bring it for us to scan it) of the road that shows the claimed distance from my property line.

My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 ft from the property line.

Please give me the window when you can be available.

Hi Darwin,

There are a lot of "assumptions" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.

The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.

I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and afternoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.

I hope you understand that all liabilities will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representative of the city of cedar park) to decide and take action (or not).


Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property.  The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane.  The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gutter to provide an additional barrier for traffic.  Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be decelerating to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes.  The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes.  There will also be a raised curb and gutter median that will provide additional separation to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this location.  The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properties are on a curve in the roadway.  Since your property is on a straight section of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locations, a barrier is not warranted in this location.  I hope this information is helpful.  Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,

Darwin

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion

Hi Darwin,

I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converting from existing 2 lanes to 4 lanes.

When this project started, we had a meeting with the city, and I clearly mentioned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, pollution etc. In the city meeting, we were told that the city will give a 3 ft fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).

The arguments given by Alan are not satisfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.

Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra
