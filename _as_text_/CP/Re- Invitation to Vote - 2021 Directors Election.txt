Filename: Mr. Denney.

Your points are invalid.

Let me explain a bit. I do not have to declare volunteership to show my affection to neighbors or neighbors.
I emailed you all that trucks are unlawfully entering the neighborhood. Who acted on it?

I dealt with the city single handed while you all were not ready to send city stern/strong legal messages or CPPD to act on it. Leave that,  there was no email to raise concern or involvement of any one of you sitting there or these 3 newcomers to take up these concerns with neighbors.

Same goes with City violations that happened right on my property with one neighbor being the city and their road. None of you (HOA, not personal) took any action. I am fighting not only for me, but for all living on Lakeline rd. I have been in advanced talks with different national level government agencies and also planning to take it with President Biden's office. What is this if not volunteering ?

Same goes with your book keepings. I pointed out that your hired company is not keeping clean books, and there is a chance of pointing fingers. What did any of these other volunteers or sitting current board members do? What actions were taken? Where is the MOM with resolution to all this? Why are you pointing one finger to me when 3 are pointing back to you all?

I can come to meetings and I will say these again. What will volunteering officially do if my unofficial volunteering is of 0 value to this board?

Also, let me tell you one more thing. This is specific to you Mr. Denney. You are posting to me all the different reasons for one thing or the other.
Examples from your reasonings of past:
  - why HOA can increase annual fee when there is $14M surplus in bank? because " other HOA has increased it too"
 - "On making Border walls" you said in the meeting "HOA cannot work for individual property because it is only for the welfare of all properties".
 - and now this, "volunteering is the first step to HOA leadership roles" ..

NONE of these arguments are legal and not rules. YOU are MAKING it up and imposing on me! Send me legal docs that show these rules are there for which HOA was formed!

And lastly, what if for some unfortunate reason (covid, accidents, personal problems, etc) the sitting HOA board or volunteers are no longer with HOA? Will this mean that now there is no HOA because no one is qualified to take leadership positions?

My point Sandeep is that you and your 11th graders have yet to volunteer to do anything positive for our neighborhood. All I have ever seen from you are complaints and venom. The fact that these people are showing up to meetings and volunteering their time already makes them much more qualified than someone who constantly complains without offering solutions.

The chat function in meetings is a way to object to anything you hear in meetings and offers a written record. The chat function also it is available throughout the meeting and we actually stop meeting to answer questions. Your statement below is not accurate.

We volunteer our time and the last thing we want to do is participate in an arguing match with a homeowner or have a homeowner constantly interrupt meetings. Any homeowner who wants to meet individually with with board is more than welcome to schedule a meeting, where during that time, they can air their grievances or concerns.

This system of meetings works for us during the pandemic but I assure you we will all be greatful to return to normal soon.

Good day,

The participation in these meetings is not a qualification to take up a role that needs real spine to talk to city, district and legal departments. My 11th grader and his friends will participate next. What will that bring?


Moreover, I did show up in a few meetings earlier even when you were not there.  The meetings are not two way communication.
The zoom controller mutes anyone and does not allow them to object to things as they proceed. Only QA is taken when most of the people are left.
Even f2f meetings when they were conducted were not that way.

Sandeep,

    Had you have shown up to any of the meetings this year, maybe you would have met Cheryl, Jason or Andrew. They have all stepped in as replacements for board members who have stepped down. There are 3 open positions and these people are the only homeowners who have stepped up to volunteer. If you would like to ask them questions, please forward them to me and I will ensure that they receive the questions but they are under no obligation to answer your questions and if you do not like that, then don't vote or write in a candidate.

Also your comment about SaraMarie is quite obtuse. She did more for this community than almost any other homeowner or board member previous to her or since. If you have a personal vendetta against her it would be best to keep that to yourself in future communications or you will be ignored and blocked. I will not tolerate personal attacks on board members or homeowners.

Good day sir,

Denney James.

I am not here to select a director by playing blind-dart games. and I am not asking for personal emails either.
Please create temp-emails within the board email server and share it by tomorrow to all residents or post them somehow (I do not care). A 10+ day window to ask questions and clarification are required.  I need transparency. And when it comes to JD they must have some set guidelines to what they work on. Otherwise someone like Sarah Marie who was representing us can just show a spineless answer saying that the work is outside the reach of her position.

I don't even know what biodata they have shared with you. How can I judge them and vote for one?

Hi Sandeep,

A director is just a position on the board.  Once the board is in place then they will decide on the officer positions and specific duties.  The candidates provided Bioâ€™s of themselves for review.  I cannot release their email addresses.

Thanks
