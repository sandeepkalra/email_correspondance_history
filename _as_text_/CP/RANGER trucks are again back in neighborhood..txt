Filename: Dear Cedar Park City Council:

Lately I am again seeing Ranger trucks out here in the neighborhood.  I am marking you in "TO" and CPPD in CC, as I think the onus is more on Council here.
I see that your mission and charter statements both mention "public safety", so please act on this request. Kindly block all heavy vehicles from taking neighborhood roads.
There are kids, pedestrians, and many more that are at risk.

I will also request HOA to start thinking about installing private entrance gates with some electronic fobs at all entrances and exits if the situation is not solvable otherwise.

I can send video proofs if you want. I just witnessed one right now (Friday MArch -25, @5:32PM CST). This is the 3rd incident I have seen in the last 2 weeks.
