Mr. Kalra,

I understand that you are seeking correspondence between your HOA and the City re: traffic safety concerns. Ms. Quinn has processed your request and found no responsive information. Ms. Quinn has personally advised me that she conducted an exhaustive search of the City’s email archiving software and found no results with Mr. Denny (denney.james@westsidehoa.org<mailto:denney.james@westsidehoa.org>) or any “@westsidehoa.org<http://westsidehoa.org>” email address as the sender/recipient. Stated differently, there is no email correspondence to provide. Aside from email correspondence, my understanding is that the City also does not have any responsive written correspondence or other records matching your search criteria.

As a point of clarification, if I may… The City is not subject to FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act (federal law), but rather the Texas Public Information Act (state law). The concept is the same – to promote transparency in government. In processing requests for information under the Texas Public Information Act, we use the search criteria provided – names, email addresses, dates, subject matter, key terms, etc. If the stated search criteria don’t turn up any results – as is the case with your request – there’s simply nothing to be provided. Sometimes – NOT the case with your request – there are statutory provisions requiring and/or authorizing certain responsive information to be withheld from disclosure. In these cases, we’re required to advise, in writing, of the basis for withholding and/or request a determination from the Texas Attorney General, and we’re required to provide a copy of that request to the original citizen requestor. Again, this is NOT the case with your request, but I wanted you to know that if there was responsive information that we’re withholding, state law requires us to let you know that we’re either withholding or seeking a determination from the Attorney General.

Again, this is NOT a case of the City exercising discretion in withholding information responsive to your request. The City’s administrative offices are located at City Hall, 450 Cypress Creek Rd., Bldg. #1, Cedar Park, Texas 78613. If you are seeking information regarding legal process, causes of action, remedies, etc., then I recommend you consult an attorney familiar with the Texas Public Information Act. I/we cannot further advise re: legal matters.

Lastly, I would advise that we receive thousands of public information requests each year, and we process each as quickly as possible, in the order its received, and pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, i.e. state law. You’re welcome to include our entire staff on emails, but it won’t yield a different or faster response.

Hi Mrs. LeAnn:

I have to get the following request.
- If someone has to sue the city in court, then what is the *address of the city of cedar park administration* that it must use, and whom shall things be addressed to?

1. The name of HOA is ‘westside HOA’.
2. I do not know names of all board members but the leadership is with Mr Denny (denney.james@westsidehoa.org<mailto:denney.james@westsidehoa.org>). All I can say is that the official email address has WestsideHOA.org in their email. So, anything coming from them raising concerns and proposed actions on safety issues etc.
3. Timeframe is Jan-01-2022 till Nov-01-2022(both end date included)
Feel free to email me if this is still not clear
Best regards

Good Morning,

In relation to your Public Information Request received by electronic mail on  November 8, 2022, the City will need additional clarification in order to continue processing your request.

Please clarify and provide:

1.       The name of the Homeowner’s Association you are referencing.

2.       The Board Member names.

a.       HOA’s are not required to register with the City, therefore we have no record that would identify Board Members by name.

3.       A timeframe for which you are seeking with a beginning and an ending date.



By providing the above information, this will assist the City with searching for any responsive doucments you are seeking.



Thank you.

Dear Mrs. LeAnn:

I have raised numerous safety concerns to the city of cedar park and to my hoa (buttercup creek) for incoming 18 wheelers passing through with stones, and fuel. I have also requested my HOA to publicly and legally ask the city to work on all such incidents.

With this email, I would like to request you under FOIA to kindly provide me with any/all Requests and concerns that my HOA board or Board members may have asked in writing (or anything legally accepted in court) to the city of cedar park or vice-versa (i.e. from city to HOA) so as to help with increasing safety violations. To narrow down you search please I am okay with only last 10 months of communication (i.e. Jan-1-2022 till Nov-1-2022).


Also, If you can compile that - If there are such requests made, then what departments worked on it, and what were the actions taken (temporary ones and the permanent ones)

I am also marking CC to JP.LeCompte as they may have worked on any legal requests that were passed by my HOA or their representatives (including board members, lawyers office etc).

Will appreciate the response from you or Mr. JP LeCompte.
