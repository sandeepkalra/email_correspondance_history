Filename: FYI All:

 I fully and loudly reject any director or HOA positions chosen this non democratic way that seems mostly illegal.  I have voted myself(+my wife, and one neighbor) to block my vote or vote for anyone of the 3 candidates.. and can revisit if things change.
This is blind-dart game in this HOA which is anyways running as a monopoly. Please reconsider and modify the voting methods. I do not accept any candidature unless then.

All communication must be in writing over email for faster response.

I am not here to select a director by playing blind-dart games. and I am not asking for personal emails either.
Please create temp-emails within the board email server and share it by tomorrow to all residents or post them somehow (I do not care). A 10+ day window to ask questions and clarification are required.  I need transparency. And when it comes to JD they must have some set guidelines to what they work on. Otherwise someone like Sarah Marie who was representing us can just show a spineless answer saying that the work is outside the reach of her position.

I don't even know what biodata they have shared with you. How can I judge them and vote for one?

Hi Sandeep,

A director is just a position on the board.  Once the board is in place then they will decide on the officer positions and specific duties.  The candidates provided Bioâ€™s of themselves for review.  I cannot release their email addresses.

Thanks

What are the designated duties of the director. Also, can I get the new participants emails. I will be emailing them questionnaire with some clarification before making up my mind.
