Filename: Dear Mrs. LeAnn:

I have a few requests under FOIA (and maybe Mr. JP. LeCompte can help here, so sending him in case he will like to directly respond).

1. I would like to know the government institutes that legally oversights the following
  - the work,
  - the conduct, and
  - the fundings of projects,
  w.r.t the public engineering work performed by Engineers at Cedar Park city.

I understand that these maybe 3 different institutes, or just 1. I kindly request all 3 points.  Also, Kindly provide me with the link and detail of the communication with them.

2. I also have a secondary question. The taxes are collected by the county and that funds partly or fully the operations, but operations are performed by the city. What is the role of the County in these engineering decisions? Are they part of oversight in operations such as public engineering work?

A simple pointer to some docs or webpage on this 2nd question will help clarify my doubts.

Sandeep Kalra
