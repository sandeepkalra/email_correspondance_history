Hi,

I am Deepshikha, Sandeep's wife.
We need to get a 3 ft concrete wall for our safety and protection. It will be unsafe for us to go to our backyard because of the adjacent road coming up. The traffic will increase and so will the noise pollution.
If you think the distance from our fence is not enough to build a wall then you can move the fence 1-2 ft inside our property line.

Please consider this request as it is a safety concern for our family.

Thanks & Regards,
Deepshikha Kalra

Hi Darwin,

I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converting from existing 2 lanes to 4 lanes.

When this project started, we had a meeting with the city, and I clearly mentioned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, pollution etc. In the city meeting, we were told that the city will give a 3 ft fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).

The arguments given by Alan are not satisfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.

Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra
