Dear Mrs. LeAnn:

I have raised numerous safety concerns to the city of cedar park and to my hoa (buttercup creek) for incoming 18 wheelers passing through with stones, and fuel. I have also requested my HOA to publicly and legally ask the city to work on all such incidents.

With this email, I would like to request you under FOIA to kindly provide me with any/all Requests and concerns that my HOA board or Board members may have asked in writing (or anything legally accepted in court) to the city of cedar park or vice-versa (i.e. from city to HOA) so as to help with increasing safety violations. To narrow down you search please I am okay with only last 10 months of communication (i.e. Jan-1-2022 till Nov-1-2022).


Also, If you can compile that - If there are such requests made, then what departments worked on it, and what were the actions taken (temporary ones and the permanent ones)

I am also marking CC to JP.LeCompte as they may have worked on any legal requests that were passed by my HOA or their representatives (including board members, lawyers office etc).

Will appreciate the response from you or Mr. JP LeCompte.
