Filename: Hi,

I am reaching out to tell you my suspicion on some possible malpractice and want to get your help to see if this suspicion is correct or not, or how to even go about checking it.

I am in Westside HOA. I have seen their accounting books that do not show clearly what kind of transactions are those, who are the receiving beneficiaries, and what kind of rules were followed to even give out the projects to other firms. I have raised this to them directly, and they acknowledge that books are only recording limited data.

I know that HOA board directors ( + families) run some companies and this is lawfully okay but then there are other HOAs with the same situation for e.g. HOA directors of another cedar park community - e.g, Twins Creek HOA directors. Now they are friends and are in Bro-culture (I know of this good relationship between these 2 HOA directors b/c if you go to ask some strongly worded questions to one on social media then other HOA directors of other community jumps in and react to it by supporting and making noise (and on social media sometimes louder noise wins!)

Now coming to my suspicion:
I think that these family businesses are all feeding each other and benefiting from people's money without disclosure and lack of transparency in billing, accounting. I do not have the tools or power to go beyond what I could do till now and now I want help from BBB or City to somehow do the checking and help review accounts here.
