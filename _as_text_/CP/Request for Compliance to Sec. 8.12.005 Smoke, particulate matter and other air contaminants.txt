Filename: Hi Kevin, Robert and Amber:

I have a new request for compliance for Cedar Park Tx. The smoke, air contaminators inside my property line next to Anderson Mill road is probably higher than exceeding four grains per 1,000 cubic feet of air as permitted by law of Cedar Park Texas. The vegetation next to the Anderson Mill road is getting killed. The photo proof of that was given to the city earlier by purchasing of two shrubs of same kind on same day and one planting on Anderson Mill road and other on gaspar bend (planted 10 feet apart, one is growing whereas other did not survive)  . Is there a way for you to proof that city is in compliance to their own section 8.12.005. A test of air quality inside my property line will be highly appreciated.

I request you to also give me a Complaint ID for this complaint.
PS: This is not a noise pollution complaint.



Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra

Dear Robert, Kevin and Amber.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).

The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road".  By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:

(1)     Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or

(2)     Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C

The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.

I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a  compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.

Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.

A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

Acoustic Beamforming: Mapping Sources of Truck Noise , link: https://books.google.com/books?id=rDyhc7WhqqIC&pg=PA7&dq=argument+motor+vehicle+motor+sound+is+not+motor+vehicle+tyre+sound&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2uMbW9evmAhUZCs0KHZ9cCjQQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=onepage&q=argument%20motor%20vehicle%20motor%20sound%20is%20not%20motor%20vehicle%20tyre%20sound&f=false

Hi,

I have been chasing the construction that was done by city of cedar park in a hurry with no safety or property paperwork and have impacted lives of many in and around my neighborhood and also wild life in Austin area. I leave up to the media to decide what could be the reason for the urgency.

There was tip from one neighbor of mine: Deep pocket owners(such as HEB) may have bought a high valued property right at intersection of 1431 and Anderson Mill road and may have pushed for better access for their own benefits. Unfortunately he may be right. The city has treated us worse than wild life is treated in Austin area.

 I have received a reply from City of Cedar park to my request made on Dec-02nd with various requests asking for the details of construction (and follow up on previous emails where I exposed to the city management that no one followed any rules - noise ordinance , safety ordinance, etc).
I have reviewed the response I got to my Dec-02-2019 email. The city response carried 0 weight. Here is the summary for the media people that I am marking in CC.

The only document that had some details was a study that was done more than a decade ago that shows that the Austin property is reserved under BCCP and that is the reason city of cedar park could not persuade to expand on that side of corridor and eventually we all residents paid the price.
- This road passes right next to Balcones Canyonlands Preserve system(BCCP Infrastructure) and the road is on the corridor that is allowed to expand but there were 0 details of clearance certificates that city of cedar park has applied for (If there were, then none were provided to me, even when I asked for it) from Travis or Williamson County, and more-so, the road was expanded to less than 16' to 30' from the hard limit put by the BCCP Infrastructure Corridor structure. The exceptions are for low traffic area, whereas this road is a high traffic area road (Way more than 750 cars in a day).

Ref : Table 3 of book, and AASHTO std is already with you to guide.
 https://books.google.com/books?id=cTc3AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA6-PA1&lpg=RA6-PA1&dq=BCCP+Infrastructure+Corridors&source=bl&ots=_Eo3sbzQOK&sig=ACfU3U0A-yfjuqfmPKHpOlkEV1gbKalGdA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi49ciP4ebmAhWJGs0KHYrLANkQ6AEwBnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=BCCP%20Infrastructure%20Corridors&f=false
I am marking CC to Wilco.org contact-personal (Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org<mailto:Lauren.Gammon@wilco.org>)
and travis contact-personal (TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov<mailto:TNRWeb@traviscountytx.gov>) to notify them for further escalation on this.
Through this email reply, I request City of Cedar Park to produce the clearance certificates and the permit to go even closer to 30' to the BCCP.

Beside this above details that I could draw from the response. This response
- Does "not" show if the city of cedar park did any study of expansion of road to the BCCP system in short or long term.
-  does "not" carry any detail of any safety measures taken after I showed them that mandatory safety checks are missing in documents.
- did "not" carry any mention of comparison to existing properties that have gone through similar checks and thus this construction is deemed safe.
- shows No action was taken on Licensed engineers for their ill-actions, and rather producing and submitting business calculations in place of engineering calculations (and more so admitting to be doing this for 20+ years).
- shows no mention of any plans to cross examine and validation of city's own noise and safety regulation compliance that clearly weren't followed.. I am still waiting for an official reply on it. It will be shame if I have to ask you to get this done by issuing court orders.


I request again to the  city of CP to please setup a 7 to 10 day validation to cross examine the safety and noise level compliance as per city ordinances inside my property line. I have even given the link of the procedure to do so by eliminating the noise generated by motors inside motor vehicle.

Sandeep Kalra

All:
I will be marking few Local news media in CC now onwards (they are now in CC).
Some international news media has also expressed interest in covering the news
but I will only go to them if the City continue to not follow their own ordinances and
do not take enough actions even after the writing them for years.

To:  LeAnn Quinn, City Official at Cedar Park TX
Subject: I need to get your official reply on couple of requests below

Dear City Officials, and City Engineers of City, and Legal Department of Cedar Park TX:

Request-0: If a resident provides a written concern, and/or request to the city. Is there any "max"  time frame set by city to respond to the concerns, and requests? What are the usual actions taken on the concerns per city? What are your SLAs for city officials and what are those for City Engineering department. Are they in week, month or years? Please provide me with the min and max timeframes as per your guidance. Also, Please let me know that for how long this data is maintained?

Request-1: On May-22,2017 the City of Cedar Park invited all residents to inform of Anderson Mill expansion project and asking for concerns. The concerns from me were emailed, read-out in the meeting, and 3 printed copies were given to the people who hosted the concerns. What were the "actions" that were taken on those concerns? Please provide me with the copy of the actions that were taken(all in last 3 years).
         Were there any meeting records, emails to show that
         there was any line of action thought to address the
         concerns?

Request-2: Around August 05, 2018, the city response shows that there were "no calculations" done for any drawings for the project. This implies that there were "safety flaws" in the design. What "actions" were taken by city to mitigate the safety concern raised out of this findings?
      Did the city engineers redo drawings with calculations to see that the
      structure is safe or will be safe? Were  there any design modifications to
      metigate the possibly of crash, reduce speed limits or placement of more
      barriers to make the road and intersection safe for residents and
      pedestrians?
      Were there any readings taken to see if the concerns were valid or not?
Please provide me with the copy of all the actions taken (All of those in last 3 years).

Request-2a: If the city has any comparable data from other sites to show that the city does not need safety calculations or is in compliance then please provide the statistics with readings, level of confidence, correlation and all other information to support your claim.

Request-3: Were there any environmental study performed (per section 8.12 regulations of city code) to see the impact of road on the health of people and/or the wildlife next to the now extended Anderson Mill road? Please provide the copy of the reports (any in last 3 year).
              If there were none, then request you to perform one right now.

Request-4: Per City code section-8.08 Noise regulations the city guarantees the residents a upper limit on noise level at various time of day. Were there any noise level checks performed after the expansion was completed? Please provide the copy of the previous 3 years of reports.

Request-5: The vehicles moving on the road are producing extremely loud noise. The noise is in part produced by tyres, and other moving parts that are accountable as per the city codes. The noise level are above and beyond the city permitted value for daytime and night times. City officials were informed to all city officials in writing in Oct-30-2019 and request for compliance was made (if not, then please treat this email as the one for the level check).
Standing inside my property line the noise level is very high and the guarantees under section-8.08 are not meeting even after removing the noise produced by "Motor Vehicle Motor" on the road.
Please conduct a study "inside my property-line" at locations offered by me to showcase that the city is in compliance to section-8.08 of noise regulations. You will need "Acoustic beam-forming based sound level meters" to claim by removing the noise produced by the motor of the vehicle.
