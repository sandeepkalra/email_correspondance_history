Filename: Dear Ms. Gloria,

It will be kind of you if you can help me by arranging possible testing for environmental studies on my property to find out levels of pollutants and noise etc. as i have not been able to convince any other party(city, engineers, or compliance) to even answer the request.

Thanks and Regards,

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):

Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife.  I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.

Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.

The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs.  I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations.  Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone.  I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had?  Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.

The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.

I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).

The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10.  9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).


Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Dear Sandeep,

Thank you very much for reaching out with this concern regarding road expansion activity affecting your local community.  You did in fact reach out correctly to the Office of Environmental Justice in EPA’s headquarters office.  I am putting you in touch with our EJ folks in EPA’s Region 6 office (responsible for Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma).

Gloria Vaughn is the EJ Coordinator for EPA Region 6 and Gerardo Acosta is I believe at present the manager over the EJ program in Region 6.

sorry I sent an email too soon. I wanted to add this

There were some end-results from the communication with some teams (though not very fruitful)
[1]  BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2]  TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3]  In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.
[4]  Engineers have verbally confessed that the safety on the property is less than other 9 properties. and without commitment said If they have resources then they may try to fix things.

To: Office of Environmental Justice:

Dear Sir/Madam:

I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.

Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.

Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.

Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.

Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.

I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City  council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.

City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.

You all:

Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.

I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

I plan to raise my voice in international forums once more if the engineers and compliance people from Texas are going to join because I genuinely believe that they will not a justice to service of America.

Subject: Re: Noise Complaints from Anderson Mill Rd.
Mr. Sam:

Thanks for the clarification about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.

I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.

Is this response of yours an official response of the City?


 Article 8.008.005 (3)     Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or attached to the motor vehicle.

o   And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the tires on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulations, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.

I am not a legal expert and I will try getting legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.

I am available mostly on Fridays after 2:00 PM.  I will only come if the session is fully recorded (Audio and Video) that I will also get access to it, and will like to know the participant's name 2 days before hand.

Dear Robert, Kevin and Amber.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).

The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road".  By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:

(1)     Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or

(2)     Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C

The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.

I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a  compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.

Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.

A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).

And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.

You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)

I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is  what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.

So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.

Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...

No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: Notice of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything

We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.

-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restrictions to enter our property still exists.

I and my wife(called "we") has collectively decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the rationale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situation at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepting the deal of just a higher (additional 2 ft) wood fence to what we have now.

We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a writing a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of buttercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next action will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.

We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustration, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execution of this project.

-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 options/plans given below.

[ Plan 1 ]  We will accept the 8 ft wooden fence if the City does the complete calculation for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in writing that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).

[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 ft wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in writing a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.

[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 ft wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 ft at the roadside.

[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything better to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculations and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 additional PE engineers appointed by City.  In this case, we will accept the 8 ft wooden fence only after making sure that the plan is safe.

Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.

-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall.  The size(15ft) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendations when we met the city for the first time in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is attached.  The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspection.

We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.

-- Rationale --
Property sits at a point where a potential 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple speculations such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all time etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No Calculations based on models developed using mathematics, science and past experiences from similar situations. No Noise control. No trees. No pollution checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properties in the similar situation in whole Cedar Park.  This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I left as an easement for utility lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an additional 2 ft high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 ft wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.

My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 ft away from the road with no protection. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 ft. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.

Add-ons Rationales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 ft barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 ft high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hitting the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeting with details) that they will give at least 3 ft barrier and retention wall to all properties, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will question them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences until they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact sections per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculations.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepting whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade Austin-City to give part of the land that Austin uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
        They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard,  so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.


-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 ft margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard:  Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 ft. Max distance is 9 ft from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane meeting point: Min is 9 ft, and the Max distance is at 10 ft from the property line.
Back Yard:  Min is 11 ft. Farthest is 20+ ft.

I am coming this weekend there in cedar Park house to personally evaluate the situation and then I will let you know.

BTW, initial email from you saying if one property owner do not agree then it will be a 'no' to all. How is it that possible that you now want to give others a fence but okay if I walk out?

Sandeep:
I am following up on the email below.  Since the fence construction is about to start sometime next week, I just wanted to check and see if the right-of-entry withdrawal is still in effect.  The fence contractor will only be out there for about a week and if you want your fence reconstructed, he needs to complete this work while he is out there.  We won’t be paying an additional mobilization fee for the contractor to come back out there after he finished the other sections of fence.

Thanks,
Alan
