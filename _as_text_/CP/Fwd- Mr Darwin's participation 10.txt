Mr. Michael:

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]

The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online).  Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.


Mr. Lance:

Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'.  Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists his Roles and Responsibilities?


Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra

Mr. Kalra:

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence.  That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the practice of engineering as it relates to the project.  I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this.  From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what information the Board would need to be able to move forward and no additional information was ever provided.

If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the practice of engineering or was unlicensed and practiced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Dear Mr. Michael
This is yet another request or reminder. I am looking for a written results to your investigation for the case that i raised with concerns of gross negligence by city officials in building the road. I was told that TBPE can not investigate because it was Mr. Green who is non PE and has been the engineer in the project. I am marking Mr. Lance in cc here.

Subject: Mr Darwin's participation

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.

Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings.  Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep Kalra

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specifications) and “E” (Estimate) part of the PS&E for the project.  We provided you with the specifications for the project as well as links to where those specifications can be found on Wednesday.  We also provided the estimate although we disagree as to what the term “estimate” is defined as.  The estimate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construction of the project.

The calculations that you have requested simply do not exist.  I have checked with the engineer that designed these construction plans and the only calculations that they performed are the drainage calculations which are found in the plans.  As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of Austin Transportation Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual.  These manuals are used as a basis for the cross section design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway.  These design criteria are used by transportation engineers throughout Texas and the United States.

I was hoping to relay this information and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeting yesterday at your house.  We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.

I noticed that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email.  I would suggest contacting Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,
Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you mention below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane.  As I mentioned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are decelerating.
Second, we have not lied, hidden information or misled you in any way.  In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.   The handrail is not located on the property line.  There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk.  The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot sitting right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated.  These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculations you are looking for.  The roadway cross sections can be found in the City of Austin’s Transportation Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted.  The cross sections and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials) design manual.  This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,

When I talked to you and others in first meeting at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ ft distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other location... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumatized us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).

There is a 12 ft sitting right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

I am not buying your speculations and assumptions and speculation about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculations that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situation will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?

If I find flaw in calculations or no calculations to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporting this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's mentioned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,

There are a lot of "assumptions" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.

The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.

I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and afternoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.

I hope you understand that all liabilities will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representative of the city of cedar park) to decide and take action (or not).

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property.  The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane.  The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gutter to provide an additional barrier for traffic.  Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be decelerating to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes.  The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes.  There will also be a raised curb and gutter median that will provide additional separation to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this location.  The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properties are on a curve in the roadway.  Since your property is on a straight section of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locations, a barrier is not warranted in this location.  I hope this information is helpful.  Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Hi Darwin,

I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converting from existing 2 lanes to 4 lanes.

When this project started, we had a meeting with the city, and I clearly mentioned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, pollution etc. In the city meeting, we were told that the city will give a 3 ft fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).

The arguments given by Alan are not satisfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.

Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?
