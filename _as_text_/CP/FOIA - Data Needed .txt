Filename: Hi,

I have to come to know that Cedar Park Council conducts every month meetings with HOA reps where homeowners are not invited (or cannot join). I will like to access Minutes of meetings from the last 3.5 years where my HOA (Buttercup creek) is involved in such meetings as I want to find the discussion on some of the topics that i have raised through them.
