Filename: Dear Mr. Lance, Mr. Sims, and City Officials:

    A very timely article to share to you and city:  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58740362

It is not far when you may see a similar article listing some wildlife from BCCP/FWS land.

Thanks Mr. Lance.

I worked with BCCP to see if there were any wrongdoings and they found nothing, so I will be submitting my request in the coming few days.
But before I do so, I will like to clarify why I was investigating engineers' wrongdoing w.r.t BCCP too.

            Wildlife has no representation other than us. The City and Engineers decided to construct a major artery road next to wildlife here.  All of us know that a drunk driver has an equal chance of entering with a 18 wheeler into wildlife, and noise+pollution will drastically affect wildlife too. A notice or permit may have forced BCCP, Lawmakers and City Engineers to study the situation and maybe look for mitigating some problems we will soon see in the next few decades. That never happened. Now BCCP officials are okay to overlook this (probably they cannot do much, similar to TBPE that cannot act on city engineers).

We combined our responsibilities for the preservation of the wildlife and somehow everyone has neglected it to the extent that they can.

Do you know what will happen just outside this BCCP land in the next 2 to 3 years. The land at 1431 and Anderson-mill road intersection is sold to HEB and AMAZON to make huge mega warehouses. Trucks will run 7x24. AMAZON has already started rolling out things that will make them the savior of wildlife.

https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22686696/jeff-bezos-amazon-billionaires-biodiversity-conservation?campaign_id=0&emc=edit_cr_20210929&instance_id=0&nl=comments-notifications&regi_id=154276465&segment_id=0&user_id=6cc7db1a85510cad9cfd2f40c7bcbcc1

 I may leave this place in the next 2 or 3 years, but the road will not leave. It will sit and kill because of lack of safety, but also because of generated noise and pollution.

Thanks,
Sandeep Kalra

Mr. Kalra,

Regarding your two questions – we are not asking that one prove a negative.  However, we do understand that a crux of your issue is that a study was not done (absence of a report) and you believe there should have been one.  In that case, it would be important for us to understand where the requirement is (if you know) that states a study was required.  Is there a city ordinance, or TXDOT requirement, etc.  If this is a best-practice situation rather than a code or ordinance requirement, then that information would be helpful as well.

As for safety issues – No, of course we do not want anything dangerous to happen to anyone and a fatality is absolutely not required for an issue to be reviewed.  If you wish to send in information from your wife, that is fine if it as a personal opinion (vs a sealed report) as she is not a PE in Texas and we don’t want to run into sealing / rule issues.  Support from specific codes, etc. is helpful .  Also any other engineering analyses or info you might have would be helpful.

You noted the BCCP requirements.  Is this for the roadway or power poles, etc?  It would be helpful to understand this piece as well.  Is the contention basically that the city was required to do a BCCP permit for the road itself?

One final comment – since a complaint is against a specific engineer, please provide your information in the context of what that engineer did or was responsible for.  For example, if a design error was made, point out how you think that engineer was related to the error.  If a study was not done, how was the engineer responsible, etc.  This will help with specifying potential violations.

I appreciate your assistance in these matters.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Lance.

Thanks for the email and  I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs

 I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following:

1.  You said - "Hunches, speculation, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an "absence of necessary safety calculations" to produce a safe design?
Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not practice the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculations?

a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculations done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a letter to support that without calculations the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 ft spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?

2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that s/he did consider these at the "design" phase to cater to need of the FEDERAL agency here. What shall I be asking them to produce?
I am attaching specific slides from BCCP presentation (REF: https://www.slideshare.net/coawildlands/2014-bc-pwkshopvoidmartinhillspope<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fcoawildlands%2F2014-bc-pwkshopvoidmartinhillspope&data=04%7C01%7CLance.Kinney%40pels.texas.gov%7Cfe1aad4ad0cb4e87666808d97b08eda9%7C1098c99873314ccc8ef647a2d6b11045%7C0%7C0%7C637676101057323339%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=lFEeQvVh6ZhrQiGAs2%2FGViPU4Nlg%2F7I%2BM5WMzVvtz7I%3D&reserved=0>)

Good morning Mr. Kalra,

As we have previously discussed, we can provide some guidance on filing a complaint and what is needed and helpful to have a complaint move forward.  I’d be happy to assist.

A couple of things to note at the start – I cannot file the complaint for you; you’ll need to complete the appropriate form and submit any evidence you have.  Also, by providing this guidance it does not mean that we are for or against any party in a complaint, nor does it infer that we will find in favor or against any particular person or entity as part of a case.  We can open a case per our laws and rules and we will processes it to its appropriate conclusion.

That being said, you noted that you wish to proceed with a complaint against the design engineer.  For any complaint, we need to meet a few particular thresholds:  a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potential violations should be as specific as possible; the potential violations must be related to the practice of professional engineering; and there must be supporting evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdiction to investigate or take action and if there is a potential violation to more forward with.

To go through these a bit more:


  *   Rule or Law violations:  please list the rules you think this individual may have violated.  You don’t need to be an attorney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direction on why you think this person did something wrong.  In addition, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specification, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules – please note that.  For example, if you think a person did not follow a national design specification or guidance, please let us know which one(s).  For contrast:  only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direction for an investigation and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated section XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of Austin’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
  *   The rule or law violations should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad.  For example, a design plan that has errors that you can identify and is signed by a specific PE may be a violation, but a general accusation that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that information.
  *   A violation must be related to the practice of professional engineering.  This determines if the board has jurisdiction to pursue the complaint.  A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal action and should be handled by the police.  On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their practice of professional engineering.
  *   The last piece is evidence:  if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can.  If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that.  If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well.  Hunches, speculation, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an investigation because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court).  In addition to this, TBPELS does not go on ‘fishing expeditions’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or entity and then search for potential violations.  We need somewhere specific to focus.  That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.

If we get this kind of information, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdiction to move forward, and then continue with an investigation.

I hope these points are helpful.

Sincerely,

Good morning Mr. Lance

I understand your point of view and I have decided to go and ask for investigation for safety in drawings made by the PE engineers for Anderson Mill Rd expansion project. I know from my past email exchanges with you that TBPE may help me write the request for investigation. I will like to get some help there in this regards. This may be my first step for asking to fix this crap facade that is built with zero knowledge of safety for travelers and resident.
Please suggest how to go about it.

Thanks

Good afternoon Mr. Kalra,

I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situation and the options we have going forward.  Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundation for this discussion.)

The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustration with the City of Cedar Park.  These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdiction to do so.

First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdiction, and limitations of the Board is needed.  The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering Practice Act (TEPA) and Board rules.  This authority includes investigating allegations that a licensed engineer has practiced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the practice of engineering.

The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdiction over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the practice of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the practice of engineering).

The Board also does not have jurisdiction over cities.  Each city is its own sovereign jurisdiction that has oversight of its roads, construction requirements, ordinances, internal operations, etc.  The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submitted to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construction, bidding, etc. of a project.  We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself.  The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc).  Those are matters under the jurisdiction of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes.  Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.

One additional note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the position to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city.  The Board can investigate complaints, but has no role in an individual actions against a city.

From reviewing the information you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideration from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.).  While the Board can investigate violations of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific actions.   We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdiction itself.  For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construction, and maintenance.  The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its portion of this road.  The Board only has limited jurisdiction related to municipalities.  Our jurisdiction over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project.  The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the additional tasks of which you are asking (conducting independent traffic studies or a safety study).   This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.

Based on the information you have provided to date, we also do not see that Section 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering Practice Act has been violated.  The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specifications, and estimates.  This means engineering plans, engineering specifications, and engineering estimates.  It does not call out any particular kind of plan or estimate, such as a safety plan or analysis.  It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E.  It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff.  As a note, engineering estimates are generally considered to be the engineering portion of a materials estimate, such as quantities and grades / specifications of different construction materials for a project.  While the costing portion can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are better equipped to know the contracting and procurement side of things.  Non-engineers doing a cost estimate would not necessarily be considered a violation of the TEPA or Board rules.

The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of Austin Transportation Manual in designing roads within the city.  This type of design is consistent with the Act.  If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.

In your communications you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier.  For this to be a potential violation, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not constructing a sound barrier.  The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be tied back to an engineer violating a specific local or state code or ordinance.

For the Board to move forward with investigating a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporting documentation, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering practice, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of Austin Transportation Manual, or violates a Board rule.   An example might be related to the safety analysis you have mentioned – while TEPA does not mandate any particular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violation.

All of this being said, we are here to investigate potential violations of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design.  If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual.  If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the practice of engineering and in violation of TEPA, then we can investigate that.  Please note a belief that there is a violation is not sufficient for the Board to take action; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.

One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violations of TEPA and under the jurisdiction of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park.  It is possible that your State Representative or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.

I know this is a long email with a lot of information, but please understand that there are restrictions on the jurisdiction of the Board and what we can / cannot do.  We need certain specific information to move forward with a case.  We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the information needed and focused on possible violations of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Sincerely,

Subject: Re: Mr Darwin's participation

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.

There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.

Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.

1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?

2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.

3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.

4.  FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.

I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?

Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra

Mr. Kalra:

It appears there has been some miscommunication or misunderstanding on this issue.

I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue.  My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11.  From my recollection, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdiction and authority of the Board.  I communicated that the Board only has jurisdiction over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the practice of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering Practice Act or Board rules.

I still have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020.  During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the practice of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules.  I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals.  I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward.  Absent one additional email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only).  As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this matter with the Board.  I have no record of any additional communication until you reached out on August 13, 2021.

The Board does not have a statute of limitations, so I am unclear what timing out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18.  If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you still can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporting documentation against each individual) and we will begin the investigation process.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

Mr. Michael:

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]

The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online).  Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.


Mr. Lance:

Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'.  Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists his Roles and Responsibilities?

Mr. Kalra:

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence.  That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the practice of engineering as it relates to the project.  I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this.  From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what information the Board would need to be able to move forward and no additional information was ever provided.

If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the practice of engineering or was unlicensed and practiced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Hi Mr. Sims:

Monday and Tuesday are a bit tight for me. I can do Wednesday 2-nd half at 3 PM CST.

If you don't mind, you must ask city to give in writing the involvement of their engineers in this project.

Subject: Mr Darwin's participation

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.

Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings.  Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specifications) and “E” (Estimate) part of the PS&E for the project.  We provided you with the specifications for the project as well as links to where those specifications can be found on Wednesday.  We also provided the estimate although we disagree as to what the term “estimate” is defined as.  The estimate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construction of the project.

The calculations that you have requested simply do not exist.  I have checked with the engineer that designed these construction plans and the only calculations that they performed are the drainage calculations which are found in the plans.  As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of Austin Transportation Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual.  These manuals are used as a basis for the cross section design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway.  These design criteria are used by transportation engineers throughout Texas and the United States.

I was hoping to relay this information and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeting yesterday at your house.  We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.

I noticed that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email.  I would suggest contacting Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,
Darwin

Dear City Engineers:

I have been waiting for "calculations or estimates" for last 2 days and today will be the last day of wait. I will wait till COB Aug-03-2018 for them. If there are somethings not turned in, I will assume that you all do not have in your possession.

I am now requesting you "ALL VERSIONS of ALL DRAWINGs", their respective "ESTIMATES or CALCULATIONS" along with their  "SPECIFICATIONS" specific to this Anderson Mill expansion project.

Please send all copies to Anderson.Mill.Road@gmail.com<mailto:Anderson.Mill.Road@gmail.com>.
(This is my alias email to hold big files and records).

I am also attaching in CC a copy of this thread to the Administrative and Legislative office of Cedar Park ("Mayor of Cedar Park", and "City Secretary").

Section 1001.407 TBPE Guide for any license engineer working on "Public Work" must support his work with 3 parts (a) Plan (b) Specifications and (3) Estimates.
I am asking for the (b) and (c). They must be in your possession from the person who sealed the design plan.

Am I wrong in assuming that licensed engineers have to abide to the TBPE Rule guide?

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you mention below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane.  As I mentioned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are decelerating.
Second, we have not lied, hidden information or misled you in any way.  In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.   The handrail is not located on the property line.  There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk.  The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot sitting right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated.  These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculations you are looking for.  The roadway cross sections can be found in the City of Austin’s Transportation Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted.  The cross sections and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials) design manual.  This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Darwin

Alan, Darwin,

When I talked to you and others in first meeting at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ ft distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other location... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumatized us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).

There is a 12 ft sitting right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

I am no
