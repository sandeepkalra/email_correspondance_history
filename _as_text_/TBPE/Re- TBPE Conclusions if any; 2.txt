Filename: Thanks Mr Michael.

         I never received the mail you attached but now I have it via email. I wishTBPE could have given more inputs on what information was insufficient from my end. I certainly am not convinced of the outcome of this request, and from my angle, there are legitimate health & safety issues with how things are moving in many cities within Texas, and I did the right thing by raising it to the right authority. That being said, I also realize that at some point, I must stop seeking further help from you all in this matter, and this is that point.

           Intrestingly, I looked at the mission of TBPE and am not surprised that your mission is primarily to block unlicensed people from tasks that can harm the public, and I think that this decision in that sense rightly upholds the mission statement.

 https://pels.texas.gov/webpolicies.htm: The mission of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors (Board) is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people in Texas by ensuring that the practice of engineering and surveying in the state is carried out only by those persons who are proven to be qualified and by regulating the practice of Professional Engineering and Surveying in Texas.

I would like to thank TBPE for reviewing my case.
