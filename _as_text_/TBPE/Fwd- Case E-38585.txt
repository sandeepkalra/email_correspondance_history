Filename: Mr. Lance:

Here is the email where I have the copy of the complaints (1st and 2nd) - 1st one was from Mrs. Deepshikha Kalra. It was filed via post, and 2nd one was filed by me online - email might be a mix of "anderson.mill.road@gmail.com<mailto:anderson.mill.road@gmail.com>", "sandeep.kalra@gmail.com<mailto:sandeep.kalra@gmail.com>", and/or "gaspar.bend@gmail.com<mailto:gaspar.bend@gmail.com>". I use all these 3 emails.

I below I am helping Mr. Michael recollect that the complaints were filed while he could not even find the complaints! And guess what Mr. Lance you are in CC

Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra

 Mr. Sims:

PFA PDF copy w/ proofs of the complaint that was filed on January-17th of 2019. It was submitted to TBPE on my request by my wife (Deepshikha Kalra). The complaint was not electronic, so copy of that is attached.

The 2nd complaint was in the form of an email. It was submitted by me from my other email address (Anderson.Mill.Road@gmail.com<mailto:Anderson.Mill.Road@gmail.com>) on Feb-22-2019 (Sorry I thought I did it in June, but it was in Feb)

The attachments are beyond the 25MB limit, so you may get a link to PDF. If TBPE Filters out these links then I am happy to send a copy of these in the mail. At a high level, In my complaints, I have highlighted how the engineers (not just Mr. Green, Mr. Darwin but all of those who have worked for Cedar Park and were involved in Anderson Mill Rd expansion) have not followed §1001.407 and have used no calculations what so ever for any public work. More so, they claim that this is the de-facto standard for them for the last 25 years. Given that 18 wheelers are now coming as close as 10 ft to my property and there are no calculations, nor comparisons make me worried every day!

Since 2019, we have also seen retaliation from Mr. Greens and Mr. Darwin (PE), and that will now be an additional complaint that I seek to file.

Mr. and Ms. Kalra:

Ms. DeVellis is no longer employed with the Board, so I am reaching out to address your concerns.  A letter will go out this week closing out Case No. E-38585 based upon your assurance to include that you are not a licensed P.E. in Texas, but California, any time that you reference being a P.E. while in Texas.  No further action is being taken regarding Case E-38585.

Regarding the bigger issue of your concerns with actions taken by the City of Cedar Park, I have talked with my staff and my understanding is that they have provided information to you on the types of issues we can and can’t open investigations on and have also provided information to you on how to file a complaint with the Board.  A review of our records shows that we have not received a complaint from you.  If you believe you have filed a formal complaint, please let me know and I will attempt to track it down or, most likely, ask that you resubmit it as I was unable to locate any record of receiving it.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Regards.

Michael Sims, P.E.
Director of Compliance & Enforcement

Hi Danielle,

I have not heard anything back from you so I hope that the email with the attached response that I posted earlier to you (on behalf of Deepshikha, as I am her courier man :-) ) worked in place of paper response.

You need not reply to this email unless you need the physical-copy mailed to your address for you to keep it on file.


Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra

Good Morning Mr. Kalra,

In the previous letter from the Board dated December 6, 2019, I asked for Mrs. Kalra to advise the Board of her rationale for designating herself as a “licensed P.E”.

After receiving her response and a copy of her California professional engineer license on  January 8, 2020, I drafted this letter (attached) for her I will also mail as a hard copy. Please see my attached letter.

The use of the word “licensed P.E.” was the  sole issue in the original complaint by Mr. Marchell, P.E. against Mrs. Kalra. If Mrs. Kalra follows the policy advisory #10 (attached), we can close this case as voluntary compliance, we look forward to her response within the timeline given in the letter.

Thank you for your email.

Subject: Case E-38585

Mr. Danielle DeVellis:

My wife (Deepshikha Kalra, in CC) received an inquiry(copy attached) from you related to case E-38585. She is sick, so I am trying to answer it to the best of my knowledge (and I prefer email for all communication).

1. Response to your case file E-38585 was dispatched by my wife on Jan-07-2020. The returned confirmation receipt and tracking number shows that it was received by your office on Jan-08-2020.

2. A copy of the response she sent on Jan-07-2020 is also attached anyways. In case you have not received the mail yet then this email must do the needful.

At this point, I want to highlight to you that this act by Mr. Darwin Marchell, P.E. and Alan Green is "act of retaliation" against me and my family just discovered through questions that they and many in cedar park engineering department are putting "business calculations" in place of "safety/engineering calculations" to do civil work from last 20 YEARS (email confirmation from them regarding it can be sent to you and to others in TBPE for reading). They even do not do comparative study.

Not only that, the city has not taken any permits for making road next to BCCP (confirmed via Travis County open records), not left mandatory 30 feet distance from BCCP, have not done any pollution and noise checks, and now its compliance department isn't even registering the complaint (Against city for noise, safety and smoke violations) to check against the city's own rules and regulations that they want others to comply.

We did raised the concern to TBPE by reporting it and asking for inquiry in Jan-2019, and then Feb-2019 and then Nov-2019. All these were surprisingly not even considered.

To me, it seems like a joke or a serious *under-developed country* style corruption. Everyone is saving each other.
