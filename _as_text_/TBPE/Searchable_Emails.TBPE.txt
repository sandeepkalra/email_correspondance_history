CC: Michael Sims <Michael.Sims@pels.texas.gov>
Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not
   Page 1 of 797

have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
 Page 2 of 797

For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
       Page 5 of 797

  3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had
   Page 6 of 797

   violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then

on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees
        with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
          Page 20 of 797

                 Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight

If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Thanks Mr. Lance.
I worked with BCCP to see if there were any wrongdoings and they found nothing, so I will be submitting my request in the coming few days.
But before I do so, I will like to clarify why I was investigating engineers' wrongdoing w.r.t BCCP too.
Wildlife has no representation other than us. The City and Engineers decided to construct a major artery road next to wildlife here. All of us know that a drunk driver has an equal chance of entering with a 18 wheeler into wildlife, and noise+pollution will drastically affect wildlife too. A notice or permit may have forced BCCP, Lawmakers and City Engineers to study the situation and maybe look for mitigating some problems we will soon see in the next few decades. That never happened. Now BCCP officials are okay to overlook this (probably they cannot do much, similar to TBPE that cannot act on city engineers).
We combined our responsibilities for the preservation of the wildlife and somehow everyone has neglected it to the extent that they can.
Do you know what will happen just outside this BCCP land in the next 2 to 3 years. The land at 1431 and Anderson-mill road intersection is sold to HEB and AMAZON to make huge mega warehouses. Trucks will run 7x24. AMAZON has already started rolling out things that will make them the savior of wildlife.
https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22686696/jeff-bezos-amazon-billionaires-biodiversity-conservation? campaign_id=0&emc=edit_cr_20210929&instance_id=0&nl=comments- notifications&regi_id=154276465&segment_id=0&user_id=6cc7db1a85510cad9cfd2f40c7bcbcc1
I may leave this place in the next 2 or 3 years, but the road will not leave. It will sit and kill because of lack of safety, but also because of generated noise and pollution.

Regarding your two quesOons – we are not asking that one prove a negaOve. However, we do understand that a crux of your issue is that a study was not done (absence of a report) and you believe there should have been one. In that case, it would be important for us to understand where the requirement is (if you know) that states a study was required. Is there a city ordinance, or TXDOT requirement, etc. If this is a best-pracOce situaOon rather than a code or ordinance requirement, then that informaOon would be helpful as well.

  As for safety issues – No, of course we do not want anything dangerous to happen to anyone and a fatality is absolutely not required for an issue to be reviewed. If you wish to send in informaOon from your wife, that is fine if it as a personal opinion (vs a sealed report) as she is not a PE in Texas and we don’t want to run into sealing / rule issues. Support from specific codes, etc. is helpful . Also any other engineering analyses or info you might have would be helpful.
You noted the BCCP requirements. Is this for the roadway or power poles, etc? It would be helpful to understand this piece as well. Is the contenOon basically that the city was required to do a BCCP permit for the road itself?
One final comment – since a complaint is against a specific engineer, please provide your informaOon in the context of what that engineer did or was responsible for. For example, if a design error was made, point out how you think that engineer was related to the error. If a study was not done, how was the engineer responsible, etc. This will help with specifying potenOal violaOons.
I appreciate your assistance in these ma]ers. Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Lance.
Thanks for the email and I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs
I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following: 1. You said - "Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an
"absence of necessary safety calculaOons" to produce a safe design?
Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not pracOce the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculaOons?
a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculaOons done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a le]er to support that without calculaOons the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 S spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?
    2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that

 s/he did consider these at the "design" phase to cater to need of the FEDERAL agency here. What shall I be asking them to produce?

As we have previously discussed, we can provide some guidance on filing a complaint and what is needed and helpful to have a complaint move forward. I’d be happy to assist.
A couple of things to note at the start – I cannot file the complaint for you; you’ll need to complete the appropriate form and submit any evidence you have. Also, by providing this guidance it does not mean that we are for or against any party in a complaint, nor does it infer that we will find in favor or against any parOcular person or enOty as part of a case. We can open a case per our laws and rules and we will processes it to its appropriate conclusion.
That being said, you noted that you wish to proceed with a complaint against the design engineer. For any complaint, we need to meet a few parOcular thresholds: a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potenOal violaOons should be as specific as possible; the potenOal violaOons must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering; and there must be supporOng evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdicOon to invesOgate or take acOon and if there is a potenOal violaOon to more forward with.
  To go through these a bit more:
 Page 29 of 797

  Rule or Law violaOons: please list the rules you think this individual may have violated. You don’t need to be an a]orney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direcOon on why you think this person did something wrong. In addiOon, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specificaOon, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules – please note that. For example, if you think a person did not follow a naOonal design specificaOon or guidance, please let us know which one(s). For contrast: only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direcOon for an invesOgaOon and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated secOon XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of AusOn’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
The rule or law violaOons should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad. For example, a design plan that has errors that you can idenOfy and is signed by a specific PE may be a violaOon, but a general accusaOon that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that informaOon.
A violaOon must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering. This determines if the board has jurisdicOon to pursue the complaint. A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal acOon and should be handled by the police. On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their pracOce of professional engineering.
The last piece is evidence: if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can. If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that. If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well. Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an invesOgaOon because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court). In addiOon to this, TBPELS does not go on ‘fishing expediOons’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or enOty and then search for potenOal violaOons. We need somewhere specific to focus. That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.
If we get this kind of informaOon, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdicOon to move forward, and then conOnue with an invesOgaOon.
I hope these points are helpful. Sincerely,
Lance Kinney, Ph.D., P.E. ExecuOve Director

On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers
      Page 33 of 797

    under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
 Page 34 of 797

    For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the
complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
        Page 37 of 797

      2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
   Page 38 of 797

       I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

          We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City
    Page 49 of 797

                of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.

Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

Mr. Michael:
We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:

his Roles and Responsibilities?

  Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

      I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

I never received the mail you attached but now I have it via email. I wishTBPE could have given more inputs on what information was insufficient from my end.

Dear Mr. Sims:
Kindly add the 2 videos to the existing proofs that I have submitted "showing that curb is not a safe enough safeguard and even a small car (leave aside huge trucks) can break past them to hit anyone who may be walking on the side of the road".
Secondly, I also think that investigating officer(s) may need clarification on claims that I made that says that over the last 25 yrs the Licensed PE engineers may have our of *negligence* been responsible for more than 2500+ people road-deaths (I think I compared it with the count of Americans that lost life in Afghanistan in 20+ yrs there). You must additionally add the calculations that I sent the other day (email below) that show how I came to that conclusion. My basis of assumption stems right from Mr. Darwin's written email that he nor anyone he knows as PE have ever practiced calculations or estimations as defined by TBPE guidelines. They are trained to *never* bypass safety but looks like they all did. I have already submitted the email from Mr. Darwin in my original submission.
If you have the email address of the investigating officer that you can share, then I can most likely request any new requests (similar to the above 2 requests) directly to him/her.
Lastly, I want to know when can I expect some decision in this case. ---

I may not be that wrong when I said that I have to wait just few hours to see a violation or accident. I sent you'll an email at 12:45 today and guess what happened at 3:45 PM, an actual accident. (youtube link as you cannot visit google-drive)
Post Accident situation (Actually I saw this first, and there was a person standing so I thought it isn't urgent, but when I went there, the actual driver was all in blood, and EMS was on its way. Then I went home to pick medical supplies but EMS arrived by the time I returned with a first aid kit and water etc).

Later, looked into my recordings to see the "Accident as it happened":
VIDEO: https://youtu.be/Vu7UqJGSe7s
The curb is the only safety the city gave to me, and it means ZERO SAFETY.
The fence of BCCP is destroyed, and if it would have been a bigger truck, then wildlife is also be in danger. Coming back to my side, It could be a pedestrian's death if it happened on my side of the property. There is 0 space for them to move once such a situation happens.

missed adding a section that does calculate how bad design within texas may have killed more than 3000+ Americans in the
      Page 77 of 797

  last 25+. yrs *IF* what Mr. Darwin (PE/Cedar Park) is true in saying that hundreds of Licensed PE engineers do not practice to either comply with TBPE guidelines and either does calculations/estimates themselves or make the designer companies that do them.
Basically, the calculation assumed that 5 to 10% of road fatalities are due to design issues. (Not arguing on the design cost). A rough figure says 10K lose life in texas road accidents every year, so per year, 500 to 1000 are because of the absence of design. Scale it to 25 yrs (as Mr. Darwin PE/Cedar Park) has suggested, and you get this astronomical number. Now, even if you take 2 to 3% as a reasonable rate, then also we have lost more Texans on road due to such absence of engineering than the total we lost in the Afgan war. I have recently written the same details to the office of the president of the USA and still have to hear back from them (I may be sending a reminder there too). It is said that all this has to come from a non- engineer and no one within the engineering community stood to safeguard the very thing that makes their identity. I hope this is an eye-opener for you and others in TBPE.

Hi Mr. Lance and Mr. Michael:
Now that I have submitted this formal complaint (again) I want to know the overall procedure at your end. Is there a place in time when you think that the submitted proofs are not enough and you need more, and I can add to the list? At what point will I come to know of the judgement if any?

Thanks for confirming. I will be down there today on or before 3:30 pm to hand over the proof to you in person.
I have already completed youtube uploads too, and one file was found duplicate and 2 files were corrupted. Also, one video was 110 MB so it is large, so I added other 3 or 4 video files that I initially did not give in the report. It does not matter if you

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
        Page 120 of 797

   Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last
25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
        Page 121 of 797

   Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a)
   Page 124 of 797

      did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
 Page 125 of 797

      City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20A
ssessment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

Mr. Sam:
Thanks for the clarificaOon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?
ArOcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or a]ached to the motor vehicle.
o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Ores on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaOons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
I am not a legal expert and I will try ge~ng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayOme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nigh~me: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
      Page 130 of 797

     Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

   Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now.

this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoOce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric]ons to enter our property s]ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecOvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra]onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaOon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepOng the deal of just a higher (addiOonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriOng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acOon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
          We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and
 Page 135 of 797

       our frustraOon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuOon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opOons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaOon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriOng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriOng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaOons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiOonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaOons when we met the city for the first Ome in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the
 Page 136 of 797

       challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecOon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaOonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenOal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula]ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ]me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the
property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaOons based on models developed using mathemaOcs, science and past experiences from similar
situaOons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluOon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properOes in the similar situaOon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe
journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uOlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi]onal 2 c high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecOon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaOonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind
enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
 Page 137 of 797

       - Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hi~ng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeOng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenOon wall to all properOes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesOon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unOl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secOons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaOons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepOng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusOn-City to give part of the land that AusOn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let
us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee]ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There
    Page 141 of 797

  is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight,
etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

[1] BCCP recently wrote to me that the city has worked in their capacity to expand and have not done any wrongdoing when expanding the road. Nothing about permits was communicated.
[2] TBPE reported that they cannot act on city P.E engineers as they are outside their investigation purview.
[3] In response to an email to City compliance, the city pushed me to the police dept for noise and pollution complaints.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
   Page 144 of 797

     Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share
 Page 145 of 797

     via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Asse
ssment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

Mr. Sam:
Thanks for the clarificaOon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?
ArOcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or a]ached to the motor vehicle.
o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Ores on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaOons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
I am not a legal expert and I will try ge~ng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.
I am available mostly on Fridays aSer 2:00 PM. I will only come if the session is fully recorded (Audio and Video) that I will also get access to it, and will like to know the parOcipant's name 2 days before hand.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayOme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nigh~me: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
Acoustic Beamforming: Mapping Sources of Truck Noise , link: https://books.google.com/books? id=rDyhc7WhqqIC&pg=PA7&dq=argument+motor+vehicle+mot or+sound+is+not+motor+vehicle+tyre+sound&hl=en&newbks= 1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2uMbW9evmAhUZCs0 KHZ9cCjQQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=onepage&q=argument%20mo tor%20vehicle%20motor%20sound%20is%20not%20motor%

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this
property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

The noise due to the the traffic on road is unimaginably high inside my house and around my property, and Safety and pollution has always been a concern from me. The inept city engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a
masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here. Reply shamelessly to this email asking for that form please.

Subject: Re: NoOce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric]ons to enter our property s]ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecOvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra]onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaOon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepOng the deal of just a higher (addiOonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
            We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriOng a worked out
 Page 153 of 797

We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriOng a worked out
      plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX) and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acOon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraOon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuOon of this project.
-- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opOons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaOon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriOng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriOng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaOons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiOonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
 Page 154 of 797

      -- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaOons when we met the city for the first Ome in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecOon.
We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaOonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenOal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on simple specula]ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ]me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaOons based on models developed using mathemaOcs, science and past experiences from similar situaOons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluOon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properOes in the similar situaOon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uOlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi]onal 2 c high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecOon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaOonales: [The ironic ones]
 Page 155 of 797

      - By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hi~ng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeOng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenOon wall to all properOes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesOon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences unOl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secOons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaOons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepOng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusOn-City to give part of the land that AusOn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to
the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee]ng point: Min is 9 S, and
 Page 156 of 797

      the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line. Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

Dear Ms. Gloria,

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
     Page 159 of 797

 The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to
the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk
away with pointing fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low-income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.
Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to
   Page 162 of 797

    wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any
 Page 163 of 797

    calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Assess
ment%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

Thanks for the clarificaOon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time.

Is this response of yours an official response of the City?

This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or a]ached to the motor vehicle.
o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Ores on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaOons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
I am not a legal expert and I will try ge~ng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.
I am available mostly on Fridays aSer 2:00 PM. I will only come if the session is fully recorded (Audio and Video) that I will also get access to it, and will like to know the parOcipant's name 2 days before hand.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
      Page 167 of 797

   (1) DayOme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nigh~me: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):

Following up with you Celeste... do you get to know who in HOA is the person to handle and respond to my email? Please add him/her by introducing it to all in the email chain. I cannot run 1:1 email for this topic. Also, Probably you were in-charge when this property was ruined by CITY, and as rep of HOA you cared nothing, How about if you would have sent strong concern letter to CITY about the life of grass, trees , shrubs, or people living on property that the road may harm.. (I have gotten notice just for not cutting grass).
And to others too, If you still work for CITY, CITY/ENGG DEPT and received this email, then you were in-charge to some part ... now if you are not representing the department, then find the person who is, introduce in here ... , and enjoy the show.
You all may feel my email shitty, but my perception about you all isn't great either. Let me SHOW my side BACKED BY EVIDENCE (proofs attached - just to show pollution)
I bought these 2 shrubs (Same brand - pics attached, same day i.e. 07/01/19 JUST 4 MONTHS BACK, same store - Home Depot, receipt attached, planted same day, and nurtured equally in all ways). I planted one on side facing Anderson Mill road, and other facing Gaspar Bend road. This is what the two looks like today morning.
Claim your halloween candy at my place when you successfully figure out which photo is for plant that faces Anderson mill road? And claim bigger packet of candies if you reply all here and tell to others "what it means living at this place 7x24x365".

  engineers (some decorated one too) just did not do things right. The Mayor and City reps were all muted and let this happen, and HOA played helpless in situation and failed in protecting the rights of the residents.
So, Starting Nov mid, I will be replacing and extending the existing fence wall on 2 sides (One facing the Anderson road, and other that is behind us) to make living better than hell as it is now. My plan is to hire a mason and build a 8 to 10 ft concrete fence wall and/or a masonry cider block wall ... I am funding from my own money(single earner here).. so you are more then welcome to send cheque/check if you want.
Looks and Beautification is not on my agenda, and if it is on yours, please reach me and tell me what I can do within my budget to do that...
No affirmative action on this email from HOA, CITY or ENGINEERS by Nov-15th-2019 will mean that they do not have any objection to the construction here. Some agencies (City, HOA etc) may want to squeeze $50 to $100 on this occassion in the name of forms and formal proceedings and show that they have the upper hand ... let me know if that is the case here.

Subject: Re: NoOce of withdrawal of permission to touch fence or change anything
We will appreciate if an email acknowledgment is made by the recipient.
-- Decision --
We reject the current fence offer made by the city of cedar park, thus the restric]ons to enter our property s]ll exists.
I and my wife(called "we") has collecOvely decided that the Anderson mill road expansion project is not safe for us and our family, friends and for any resident around our property. Our decision is based on the ra]onale that is posted towards the end of this email. As with the situaOon at hand, we see absolutely no benefits in accepOng the deal of just a higher (addiOonal 2 S) wood fence to what we have now.
We see this moment as an opportunity to either get a wriOng a worked out plan for our safety from HOA(The HOA of bu]ercup creek, Cedar Park, TX)
and/or City (The city of cedar park) or else to tell them (to HOA and/or City) what our next acOon will be in case they fail to provide us with the basic safety, security, and peace of mind.
We also see this moment to tell what we see wrong in this project and our frustraOon, sadness, and loss of trust for the engineers, City, and/or HOA involved directly or indirectly with the execuOon of this project.
           Page 171 of 797

     -- What we will accept --
we will accept one of the 4 opOons/plans given below.
[ Plan 1 ] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City does the complete calculaOon for the worst case for the whole project and guarantee us in wriOng that the risks are less than 1% for anyone standing on my property line or the sidewalk next to it (at any place).
[ Plan 2] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City and/or the HOA undertakes in wriOng a non-revokable, and with no statuary-limits undertaking that any accidents will be compensated with more than $50m / per person involved.
[ Plan 3] We will accept the 8 S wooden fence if the City makes for us a barrier of 3 S at the roadside.
[ Plan 4] This is the open-ended plan. If HOA and/or City have anything be]er to offer and also guaranteed to be safe and secure (must be backed by calculaOons and previous data of similar deployments) then we are also open to considering them. All the documents must be developed by licensed engineers and must be backed by 2 addiOonal PE engineers appointed by City. In this case, we will accept the 8 S wooden fence only aSer making sure that the plan is safe.
Note: The deadline for the agreement is either "End of the current project" or "The day when the lane next to our property is ready for the public to use". Whichever comes first.
-- otherwise, what we plan on doing next --
We will build our own wall. The size(15S) and material(concrete or stone) were already published by us in our recommendaOons when we met the city for the first Ome in May 2017. The concerns (in form of PDF, called concerns.pdf) were given to them as a resident who has been facing the challenges out from this development since Jan 2017. A copy of it is a]ached. The readings will be from the outside of the property (i.e. at walkway level). We will not provide access to anyone from HOA or city to enter our property for any inspecOon.
 Page 172 of 797

     We may possibly go to the law of the state and TBPE and ask for our safety and to showcase the wrongdoings of state and the licensed engineers.
-- RaOonale --
Property sits at a point where a potenOal 40000 lbs to 80,000 lbs 18 wheelers are allowed northbound @ 40 mph. Part of the project is developed on
simple specula]ons such as all drivers are slow, no one will overtake, no one will be drunk at all ]me etc). There are no checks and balances if they turn right or just park right next to the property. No street lights next to the
walkway. No red-lights to make the traffic stop or slow down. No Barrier to protect our safety from 18 wheelers. No CalculaOons based on models developed using mathemaOcs, science and past experiences from similar situaOons. No Noise control. No trees. No polluOon checks. No risk analysis. The city is not even able to find 20 other properOes in the similar situaOon in whole Cedar Park. This walkway is the most unsafe journey that my family will be taking from my own house to the backyard land that I leS as an easement for uOlity lines. 100% risk, and for rewards it is just an addi]onal 2 c high wood fence?. The unprotected walkway will be used by kids going to school, bicycles, joggers and others pedestrians. Walkway to deer creek elementary was merely 5-6 S wide in few places while I took the journey to elementary school.
My front yard is now almost unusable with just 6 to 8 S away from the road with no protecOon. 400+ vehicles per day make it equivalent of highway (Ref: Greenbook, AASHTO, 2001). With the distance of road as close as 6 S. to our property line, we do not feel safe. See addendum on Measurements for the readings.
Add-ons RaOonales: [The ironic ones]
- By the engineer's argument: The drivers on this road are blind enough to not see the 3-4 S barrier and need a line of sight else they will crash in, but the drivers surprisingly have 20/20 vision when a 3 to 4 S high kid is on the same walkway.
- Texas ranks 11th (out of 50 states) in drunk driving accidents (2017 data). Yet the engineers never envision a single drunk driver of the car, or the truck hi~ng the curb or side of the road.
- The engineers can promise (we have 10+ residents as the witness and possibly a recording audio of meeOng with details) that they will give at least 3 S barrier and retenOon wall to all properOes, and they can simply walk back their own words because they think no one will quesOon them.
- The city and HOA would not accept different looking boundary walls/fences
 Page 173 of 797

     unOl they have to offer it and someone can say no and end up with different wall/fence than others. Looks like the rules are just for the residents and not for city and HOA.
- Licensed PE Engineers are asked for engineering documents with reference to exact secOons per TBPE documents, and they get back with Business documents and cost calculaOons.
- The city will ask for concerns from those who will face the music 7 x 24 x 365 (i.e. the residents), but mute itself into accepOng whatever the engineers suggest who are running this project as their backyard project.
- The city failed to persuade AusOn-City to give part of the land that AusOn uses for birds, so Cedar Park picked up the fight with local residents because they can do so.
-- The mindset of the City and HOA is worrisome here:
They have just one line of thought: If one property owner gets a wall or different barrier because of the valid safety concerns then others may ask for it and the job of denying them will be hard, so let us not give it to the resident with reasons.
-- Addendum: Measurements (+- 0.2 S margin )--
Readings are taken on my property (from front to back). All readings were taken from the edge of curb to property line.
Front Yard: Min distance to the road from my property line is 6 S. Max distance is 9 S from the property line.
From fence start to the point the right lane mee]ng point: Min is 9 S, and the Max distance is at 10 S from the property line.
Back Yard: Min is 11 S. Farthest is 20+ S.

A very timely article to share to you and city: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58740362

I worked with BCCP to see if there were any wrongdoings and they found nothing, so I will be submitting my request in the coming few days.
But before I do so, I will like to clarify why I was investigating engineers' wrongdoing w.r.t BCCP too.
Wildlife has no representation other than us. The City and Engineers decided to construct a major artery road next to wildlife here. All of us know that a drunk driver has an equal chance of entering with a 18 wheeler into wildlife, and noise+pollution will drastically affect wildlife too. A notice or permit may have forced BCCP, Lawmakers and City Engineers to study the situation and maybe look for mitigating some problems we will soon see in the next few decades. That never
   Page 178 of 797

 happened. Now BCCP officials are okay to overlook this (probably they cannot do much, similar to TBPE that cannot act on city engineers).
We combined our responsibilities for the preservation of the wildlife and somehow everyone has neglected it to the extent that they can.
Do you know what will happen just outside this BCCP land in the next 2 to 3 years. The land at 1431 and Anderson-mill road intersection is sold to HEB and AMAZON to make huge mega warehouses. Trucks will run 7x24. AMAZON has already started rolling out things that will make them the savior of wildlife.
https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22686696/jeff-bezos-amazon-billionaires-biodiversity-conservation? campaign_id=0&emc=edit_cr_20210929&instance_id=0&nl=comments- notifications&regi_id=154276465&segment_id=0&user_id=6cc7db1a85510cad9cfd2f40c7bcbcc1
I may leave this place in the next 2 or 3 years, but the road will not leave. It will sit and kill because of lack of safety, but also because of generated noise and pollution.

Regarding your two quesOons – we are not asking that one prove a negaOve. However, we do understand that a crux of your issue is that a study was not done (absence of a report) and you believe there should have been one. In that case, it would be important for us to understand where the requirement is (if you know) that states a study was required. Is there a city ordinance, or TXDOT requirement, etc. If this is a best-pracOce situaOon rather than a code or ordinance requirement, then that informaOon would be helpful as well.
As for safety issues – No, of course we do not want anything dangerous to happen to anyone and a fatality is absolutely not required for an issue to be reviewed. If you wish to send in informaOon from your wife, that is fine if it as a personal opinion (vs a sealed report) as she is not a PE in Texas and we don’t want to run into sealing / rule issues. Support from specific codes, etc. is helpful . Also any other engineering analyses or info you might have would be helpful.
You noted the BCCP requirements. Is this for the roadway or power poles, etc? It would be helpful to understand this piece as well. Is the contenOon basically that the city was required to do a BCCP permit for the road itself?
One final comment – since a complaint is against a specific engineer, please provide your informaOon in the context of what that engineer did or was responsible for. For example, if a design error was made, point out how you think that engineer was related to the error. If a study was not done, how was the engineer
      Page 179 of 797

  responsible, etc. This will help with specifying potenOal violaOons. I appreciate your assistance in these ma]ers.

  Dear Mr. Lance.
Thanks for the email and I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs
I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following: 1. You said - "Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an
"absence of necessary safety calculaOons" to produce a safe design?
Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not pracOce the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculaOons?
a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculaOons done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a le]er to support that without calculaOons the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 S spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?
2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that s/he did consider these at the "design" phase to cater to need of the FEDERAL agency here. What shall I be asking them to produce?
I am attaching specific slides from BCCP presentation

As we have previously discussed, we can provide some guidance on filing a complaint and what is needed and helpful to have a complaint move forward. I’d be happy to assist.
A couple of things to note at the start – I cannot file the complaint for you; you’ll need to complete the appropriate form and submit any evidence you have. Also, by providing this guidance it does not mean that we are for or against any party in a complaint, nor does it infer that we will find in favor or against any parOcular person or enOty as part of a case. We can open a case per our laws and rules and we will processes it to its appropriate conclusion.
That being said, you noted that you wish to proceed with a complaint against the design engineer. For any complaint, we need to meet a few parOcular thresholds: a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potenOal violaOons should be as specific as possible; the potenOal violaOons must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering; and there must be supporOng evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdicOon to invesOgate or take acOon and if there is a potenOal violaOon to more forward with.
To go through these a bit more:
Rule or Law violaOons: please list the rules you think this individual may have violated. You don’t need to be an a]orney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direcOon on why you think this person did something wrong. In addiOon, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specificaOon, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules –
   Page 183 of 797

   please note that. For example, if you think a person did not follow a naOonal design specificaOon or guidance, please let us know which one(s). For contrast: only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direcOon for an invesOgaOon and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated secOon XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of AusOn’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
The rule or law violaOons should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad. For example, a design plan that has errors that you can idenOfy and is signed by a specific PE may be a violaOon, but a general accusaOon that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that informaOon.
A violaOon must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering. This determines if the board has jurisdicOon to pursue the complaint. A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal acOon and should be handled by the police. On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their pracOce of professional engineering.
The last piece is evidence: if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can. If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that. If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well. Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an invesOgaOon because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court). In addiOon to this, TBPELS does not go on ‘fishing expediOons’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or enOty and then search for potenOal violaOons. We need somewhere specific to focus. That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.
If we get this kind of informaOon, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdicOon to move forward, and then conOnue with an invesOgaOon.
I hope these points are helpful. Sincerely,

Thanks
On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re- set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
   Page 187 of 797

     From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
 Page 188 of 797

     All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
      Page 191 of 797

       3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
   Page 192 of 797

        I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.

He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

           guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Mr. Kalra:
Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway
    Page 203 of 797

                 as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier

Thanks Mr. Lance.
I worked with BCCP to see if there were any wrongdoings and they found nothing, so I will be submitting my request in the coming few days.
But before I do so, I will like to clarify why I was investigating engineers' wrongdoing w.r.t BCCP too.
Wildlife has no representation other than us. The City and Engineers decided to construct a major artery road next to wildlife here. All of us know that a drunk driver has an equal chance of entering with a 18 wheeler into wildlife, and noise+pollution will drastically affect wildlife too. A notice or permit may have forced BCCP, Lawmakers and City Engineers to study the situation and maybe look for mitigating some problems we will soon see in the next few decades. That never happened. Now BCCP officials are okay to overlook this (probably they cannot do much, similar to TBPE that cannot act on city engineers).
We combined our responsibilities for the preservation of the wildlife and somehow everyone has neglected it to the extent that they can.
Do you know what will happen just outside this BCCP land in the next 2 to 3 years. The land at 1431 and Anderson-mill road intersection is sold to HEB and AMAZON to make huge mega warehouses. Trucks will run 7x24. AMAZON has already started rolling out things that will make them the savior of wildlife.

I may leave this place in the next 2 or 3 years, but the road will not leave. It will sit and kill because of lack of safety, but also because of generated noise and pollution.

Regarding your two quesOons – we are not asking that one prove a negaOve. However, we do understand that a crux of your issue is that a study was not done (absence of a report) and you believe there should have been one. In that case, it would be important for us to understand where the requirement is (if you know) that states a study was required. Is there a city ordinance, or TXDOT requirement, etc. If this is a best-pracOce situaOon rather than a code or ordinance requirement, then that informaOon would be helpful as well.
As for safety issues – No, of course we do not want anything dangerous to happen to anyone and a fatality is absolutely not required for an issue to be reviewed. If you wish to send in informaOon from your wife, that is fine if it as a personal opinion (vs a sealed report) as she is not a PE in Texas and we don’t want to run into sealing / rule issues. Support from specific codes, etc. is helpful . Also any other engineering analyses or info you might have would be helpful.
You noted the BCCP requirements. Is this for the roadway or power poles, etc? It would be helpful to understand this piece as well. Is the contenOon basically that the city was required to do a BCCP permit for the road itself?
One final comment – since a complaint is against a specific engineer, please provide your informaOon in the context of what that engineer did or was responsible for. For example, if a design error was made, point out how you think that engineer was related to the error. If a study was not done, how was the engineer responsible, etc. This will help with specifying potenOal violaOons.
I appreciate your assistance in these ma]ers. Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Lance.
Thanks for the email and I will say that this is a good start. I am in the information collection phase now. I will follow up on your advice to start collecting the information that can correctly fulfil the needs
        Page 211 of 797

 I have 2 questions as of now. What will be needed from my side to do the following: 1. You said - "Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us". What is valid evidence for an
"absence of necessary safety calculaOons" to produce a safe design?
Shall I wait for an accident and some Americans killed before opening a report? What are a few "tangible evidence" I may need to collect to claim that the PE Engineer did not pracOce the professional engineering by ignoring to do any safety calculaOons?
a) I do have an email from the design engineer's firm rep saying that there were NO calculaOons done. Is that sufficient?
b) My wife is a licensed PE engineer in CA (not TX). Can she write a le]er to support that without calculaOons the structures cannot be proved safe?
c) I have video proof of heavy vehicles (18 wheelers) moving in and out of the neighborhood. They squeeze an American standing on the roadside to a bare min of 8 to 10 S spot and a mistake by a driver can be deadly for the American?
2. The PE engineers from the city and the private firm who did the design must also prove that s/he did consider these at the "design" phase to cater to need of the FEDERAL agency here. What shall I be asking them to produce?
I am attaching specific slides from BCCP presentation

 On Wed, Sep 15, 2021 at 10:13 AM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good morning Mr. Kalra,
As we have previously discussed, we can provide some guidance on filing a complaint and what is needed and helpful to have a complaint move forward. I’d be happy to assist.
A couple of things to note at the start – I cannot file the complaint for you; you’ll need to complete the appropriate form and submit any evidence you have. Also, by providing this guidance it does not mean that we are for or against any party in a complaint, nor does it infer that we will find in favor or against any parOcular person or enOty as part of a case. We can open a case per our laws and rules and we will processes it to its appropriate conclusion.
That being said, you noted that you wish to proceed with a complaint against the design engineer. For any complaint, we need to meet a few parOcular thresholds: a person must have violated or be suspected of having violated one or more of our laws and/or rules; the potenOal violaOons should be as specific as possible; the potenOal violaOons must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering; and there must be supporOng evidence provided. These all help us determine if we have jurisdicOon to invesOgate or take acOon and if there is a potenOal violaOon to more forward with.
To go through these a bit more:
Rule or Law violaOons: please list the rules you think this individual may have violated. You don’t need to be an a]orney or engineering expert, but we do need to have some direcOon on why you think this person did something wrong. In addiOon, if you believe they violated some other ordinance, specificaOon, design standard, or other law (related to engineering) but outside of our laws or rules – please note that. For example, if you think a person did not follow a naOonal design specificaOon or guidance, please let us know which one(s). For contrast: only saying, “I think this person is a bad engineer” does not provide much direcOon for an invesOgaOon and is not helpful for a case; but saying, “I think Engineer X violated secOon XYZ because they did XXX and didn’t follow the City of AusOn’s ordinance ABC because of ZZZ” is much more helpful.
The rule or law violaOons should also be something specific that you believe the individual violated and not over-broad. For example, a design plan that has errors that you can idenOfy and is signed by a specific PE may be a violaOon, but a general accusaOon that everyone at a company probably does a bad job is very broad and we can’t act on that informaOon.
A violaOon must be related to the pracOce of professional engineering. This determines if the board has jurisdicOon to pursue the complaint. A complaint that said, “Engineer X stole my car”, while it may be a crime, is a criminal acOon and should be handled by the police. On the other hand, if you said “Engineer X did not perform the engineering work I paid him for”, this is directly related to their pracOce of professional engineering.
The last piece is evidence: if there are issues with certain design plans, please provide them if you can. If you have a report that does not meet code, please provide that. If you have evidence from another engineer that says the first engineer is in error and shows how and why, that is very helpful as well. Hunches, speculaOon, hearsay, etc. are insufficient bases for us to open an invesOgaOon because they are very difficult to prove (and may not even be usable if the case goes to court). In addiOon to this, TBPELS
   Page 214 of 797

  does not go on ‘fishing expediOons’ – that is, we can’t just gather all of the records of a person or enOty and then search for potenOal violaOons. We need somewhere specific to focus. That is why tangible evidence such as reports and designs are so important.
If we get this kind of informaOon, we can open a case, determine if we have jurisdicOon to move forward, and then conOnue with an invesOgaOon.
I hope these points are helpful. Sincerely,

I understand your point of view and I have decided to go and ask for invesOgaOon for safety in drawings made by the PE engineers for Anderson Mill Rd expansion project. I know from my past email exchanges with you that TBPE may help me write the request for invesOgaOon. I will like to get some help there in this regards. This may be my first step for asking to fix this crap facade that is built with zero knowledge of safety for travelers and resident.
Please suggest how to go about it. Thanks

On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
          Page 217 of 797

    The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
 Page 218 of 797

    Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
 Page 219 of 797

    I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
  I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety
 Page 222 of 797

      parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints,
   Page 223 of 797

       you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a

If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
          Page 237 of 797

                   First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you
          Page 238 of 797

they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.

Dear Gloria (EPA Govt):
Please find attached 2 of the many complaint emails and responses that I have exchanged with the city of cedar park. There is a
         Page 240 of 797

very high level of noise and pollution level inside my property line. The city has not addressed them and I have been asking them for the last 3 years before ultimately coming to EPA help. They have not even sent anyone to conduct a study of noise and/or pollution on my property. They removed 3 huge trees and extended the road to merely 10 feet away from my property. All this was done because the city could not claim land on another side that belongs to BCCP (a federal body) that takes care of wildlife. I wrote to the city my concerns loud and clear before they started the project. Then raised it to HOA to voice it. Spoke of it in city meetings, engineering meetings and also shown through numerous emails how trucks, heavy vehicles, fuel and gas vehicles, etc violate the traffic every day.
Even a request for a speedometer to show speeding is not even installed. The idea is to not measure it so that it can never be claimed as wrongdoing. A contractor who once measured the noise level for other neighbors (Brian Hall) was warned by city engineers of contracts he may miss so he bailed out.
The engineers did "not" do any safety calculations, and even TBPE (CC Mr. Lance, TBPE) is unable to fix them as they cannot rule over city decisions.
City engineers have done ZERO (Maths: 0) Safety Calculations for the last 25+yrs. I do not think they know how to do it at all. They outsource this and then just submit "Accounting calculations" in the column of calculations. Imagine all the lives lost due to this in the last 25 years. I fail to understand how this white-collar killing of American lives is okay for anyone. I will definitely write to the president's office to not offer any Texas state engineer any job when the infrastructure bill is rolled out for planning and implementation. These engineers will just kill people and probably walk away with pointing
fingers at speeding trucks, traffic, and bad sight, etc.
There is a road - "Lakeline Blvd" in Cedar Park. The neighbors from the road have been asking for protection for years. I have seen their hue and cry too. What is the fix that engineers had? Every time an accident happens (and who knows some life also lost in past 25 yrs) they fix road by putting red-light and signboards.
The city engineers have always pushed me to interact with the police in order to deal with noise and pollution. In my country (India) police do not do pollution control or noise control. It seems weird asking them for sending equipment and doing the readings first.
I will like pollution checks and noise level meters checks. The noise level meters must be with directional microphones as they are generated by transportation vehicles' tires and body parts (not engine).
The 10 households were impacted by this road expansion. 3 Indian minority groups, 1 black minority, 1 LGBT minority, and 1 low- income retired family out of 10. 9 of the families have roads farther away than mine, and also have a tiny 4 ft wall to protect to some extend (though it is not enough I believe).
Any vegetation I have planted on the roadside is dead in days, the noise inside the property line is beyond 100 DB at night and more in the day, rarely seen any 18 wheeler following traffic rules, and the city is now gearing to sell properties around the area to Amazon and HEB and their trucking will be making it more unsafe than ever.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am not sure if I am reaching out to the right people that can act in any capacity to help me. Please reply back if this is wrong group to ask for help.

   Background:
This is the background: In 2017 my city(City of Cedar Park TX) decided to hurry up and expand a road next to my home for giving benefits to other towns and potentially sell land at higher value to suiter companies such as Amazon and HEB. In doing so, they violated many city ordinances such as (a) did not take permits with Balcones Canyonland(BCCP, a federal body) to expand the road next to wildlife, (b) Engineers did not do safety studies, nor did they followed TXDOT guidances to take permits (c) Licensed Engineers did not submit any calculations for the project. But being part of the city these all kind of let go when I approached TBPE and BCCP.
Impact:
It has also negatively impacted many residents, and one primarily family is mine as our family was the only 1 out of 10 impacted to not even receive any safety barriers, and the road was brought nearest to my home (it sits just 10 to 11 ft away from property line) with just a walkway in between. I have also seen deterioration in quality of air, and all vegetation being killed that I planted.
Concerns:
I would also like to say that I voiced my concerns in writing even before the project started because I was seeing this coming. We all know that the city pushed the road on our side because it lost in negotiations with BCCP to acquire a road to expand on the other side. I am also attaching with the concerns.pdf that I posted to the city.
Communication:
I have written numerous emails to the city, their engineering, and their compliance department to conduct tests and verify the noise levels and pollution levels inside my property boundary both in the back and front side but have been redirected from one place to another because they know that it will not give them the right results and may put them in fix.
I have more than 20+ MB of email communication in last 4 yrs that I can share via
 Page 244 of 797

   google drive. I have communicated with B.C.C.P, T.B.P.E, H.O.A, City Compliance team, City Attorneys, City Engineerings, City Mayor, City council, and various local news papers. I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Assessm
ent%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

I have even raised concern in Williamson county property court to the county judges.
City engineers have "on record" mentioned in email that they do not do any calculations nor mandate one from the PE engineers who do design planning. I further went to the PE that did the design and he was indeed missing all calculations (again I have written proof of it all).
Many of the other roads here are with similar problems. In my city another road "Lakeline road" has undergone improvements with a lot of similar hue and cry such as mine and when there are accidents and loss of life then city comes in and add a bandaid speeding meter or red-light. I am not sure how is this normal.
You all: *Ref1:http://www.183north.com/005_183N%20Community%20Impact%20Assessm
ent%20Tech%20Report.pdf
Recently I came across this web report*(Ref1) that probably makes me qualify as person from "minority group" as I am from India and actually out of 10 families impacted, 4 are from india and one is a LGBTQ couple, so we are all kind of minority and want to see if Office of Environmental Justice can help me with this.
I do not know what to do next other than emailing and asking for help.

Good morning Mr. Lance
I understand your point of view and I have decided to go and ask for invesOgaOon for safety in drawings made by the PE engineers for Anderson Mill Rd expansion project. I know from my past email exchanges with you that TBPE may help me write the request for invesOgaOon. I will like to get some help there in this regards. This may be my first step for asking to fix this crap facade that is built with zero knowledge of safety for travelers and resident.
Please suggest how to go about it. Thanks

On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city
      Page 254 of 797

  council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and
maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and
 Page 255 of 797

  examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
      Page 258 of 797

    3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
   Page 259 of 797

     I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

        The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

          Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that
           Page 273 of 797

                 way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance.

Thanks
On Thu, Sep 2, 2021 at 1:47 PM Lance Kinney <Lance.Kinney@pels.texas.gov> wrote: Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
  Page 275 of 797

 The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas
 Page 276 of 797

 Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with
 Page 277 of 797

 a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

        Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
 Page 279 of 797

   There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?
 Best Regards,

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)
Do you keep recordings of phone calls?

Thank you for your email. I spoke to Mr. Sims about this at length today and he passed along that he worked with you last year about how to file a complaint and provide evidence, etc. We understand that you have concerns and he will be in contact with you soon to clarify where this issue stands and what the opOons are going forward.
As for his role – he is the Director in charge of the compliance and enforcement division and oversees invesOgaOons and the invesOgaOve team.

Mr. Michael:
We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:
Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'. Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists his Roles and Responsibilities?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

             Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the
    Page 291 of 797

             geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub- clauses.

Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
 I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do
Page 300 of 797

engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be

I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?

  Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I
    Page 315 of 797

            previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Are you available for coming down to the property and show us the 11 S distance that you talked about? Also, Please send a copy of the drawings (or bring it for us to scan it) of the road that shows the claimed distance from my property line.
My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 S from the property line.
Please give me the window when you can be available.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "

Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
 I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do
Page 324 of 797

engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be
 Page 325 of 797

 addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?

  Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I
    Page 339 of 797

            previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
 I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do
Page 348 of 797

engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be
 Page 349 of 797

 addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:
Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'. Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists his Roles and Responsibilities?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I
    Page 363 of 797

            previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Good aSernoon Mr. Kalra,
 I have spoken at length with Mr. Sims concerning your situaOon and the opOons we have going forward. Below is an in-depth discussion of several items (note – it is somewhat long but we feel necessary to re-set the foundaOon for this discussion.)
The Board understands your concern with the safety of Anderson Mill Road and your home and your frustraOon with the City of Cedar Park. These are important issues and we will try to assist you in areas in which we have the legal authority and jurisdicOon to do so.
First, I feel some background on the authority, jurisdicOon, and limitaOons of the Board is needed. The Board was created by the Texas Legislature to license professional engineers and assure individuals are complying with the Texas Engineering PracOce Act (TEPA) and Board rules. This authority includes invesOgaOng allegaOons that a licensed engineer has pracOced engineering in a manner that violates TEPA or Board rules or that an unlicensed individual has engaged in the pracOce of engineering.
The Board does not necessarily have any jurisdicOon over acts taken by a professional engineer when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering (for example, a P.E.’s management style or decision making when he or she is not engaged in the pracOce of engineering).
The Board also does not have jurisdicOon over ciOes. Each city is its own sovereign jurisdicOon that has oversight of its roads, construcOon requirements, ordinances, internal operaOons, etc. The plans for buildings, roadways, and other engineering projects are not submi]ed to the Board for review or approval and we do not have any role in the acceptance, construcOon, bidding, etc. of a project. We are not involved in the oversight of a city or a city department as to what codes they adopt or implement, or the internal workings of the city itself. The Board does not have the authority to audit a City’s Public Works or Engineering Department or to conduct studies (safety studies, traffic studies, etc). Those are ma]ers under the jurisdicOon of the city itself – the city council, mayor, or whatever structure the city leadership takes. Again, we are charged with the licensure of individual engineers and engineering firms and compliance as it relates directly to the TEPA.
One addiOonal note – as discussed previously, the Board also is not in the posiOon to advocate for or against individuals in disagreements with a city. The Board can invesOgate complaints, but has no role in an individual acOons against a city.
From reviewing the informaOon you have provided, it is clear that you have concerns about the decision making coming out of the City of Cedar Park’s Engineering Department as it relates to Anderson Mill and your home, and want consideraOon from the city (such as a fence or wall, etc.). While the Board can invesOgate violaOons of TEPA, the Board has no authority to ask or demand a City or City Department to take specific acOons. We are not charged with overseeing projects such as roadways – that is the purview of the jurisdicOon itself. For example – for a Texas highway, TXDOT is responsible for the roadway, its design, construcOon, and maintenance. The same framework is in place for roadways within a city – Cedar Park is responsible for its porOon of this road. The Board only has limited jurisdicOon related to municipaliOes. Our jurisdicOon over a city is to ensure that they hire engineers to do
Page 372 of 797

engineering work, which the City of Cedar Park seems to have done in this project. The Board does not have the authority to undertake many of the addiOonal tasks of which you are asking (conducOng independent traffic studies or a safety study). This would be something that the city would do, if required by a code, ordinance, law, or other guidance, or if they agree to do so independently.
Based on the informaOon you have provided to date, we also do not see that SecOon 1001.407 of the Texas Engineering PracOce Act has been violated. The law requires that a municipality engage a P.E. for engineering plans, specificaOons, and esOmates. This means engineering plans, engineering specificaOons, and engineering esOmates. It does not call out any parOcular kind of plan or esOmate, such as a safety plan or analysis. It simply means that any engineering work that is done must be done by a P.E. It seems that they have met this requirement through Binkley Barfield or internal engineering staff. As a note, engineering esOmates are generally considered to be the engineering porOon of a materials esOmate, such as quanOOes and grades / specificaOons of different construcOon materials for a project. While the cosOng porOon can be done by an engineer (and if done by an engineer should be signed/sealed), in some instances, the actual pricing of materials would be done by procurement or purchasing staff as they are be]er equipped to know the contracOng and procurement side of things. Non-engineers doing a cost esOmate would not necessarily be considered a violaOon of the TEPA or Board rules.
The City indicated that they have adopted and use the standards published by AASHTO and the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual in designing roads within the city. This type of design is consistent with the Act. If you have concerns that there are specific design problems, a complaint should be filed against the design engineer, who appears to be Gregory Calkins, P.E.
In your communicaOons you also discuss the lack of a sound barrier. For this to be a potenOal violaOon, you would need to provide a local or state code or ordinance that is being violated by not construcOng a sound barrier. The Board understands that you believe such a barrier is warranted, but the lack of the barrier would need to be Oed back to an engineer violaOng a specific local or state code or ordinance.
For the Board to move forward with invesOgaOng a complaint, you would need to provide specific instances and examples, with supporOng documentaOon, of where the design is inconsistent with generally accepted engineering pracOce, is in conflict with the AASHTO standards or the City of AusOn TransportaOon Manual, or violates a Board rule. An example might be related to the safety analysis you have menOoned – while TEPA does not mandate any parOcular report or analysis be done, if a safety analysis is required by a standard or code and it was not done or done incorrectly, then it would be something that a P.E. should have done and could be a violaOon.
All of this being said, we are here to invesOgate potenOal violaOons of TEPA as set out above. If you believe that individual engineers made mistakes involving the design of the road or road expansion, then a complaint can be filed against the individual engineers that did the design. If you believe that there are design issues by an engineer at Binkley Barfield, the complaint would be against that individual. If an engineer from the City of Cedar Park made specific mistakes in the pracOce of engineering and in violaOon of TEPA, then we can invesOgate that. Please note a belief that there is a violaOon is not sufficient for the Board to take acOon; you need to indicate a specific code or ordinance that is being violated in the complaint.
One final note - outside of specific engineering issues that are related to violaOons of TEPA and under the jurisdicOon of the Board, we note that it appears many of the other concerns with the engineering department would best be
 Page 373 of 797

 addressed to the city government (city council or mayor) of Cedar Park. It is possible that your State RepresentaOve or State Senator could assist with your issues with the city.
I know this is a long email with a lot of informaOon, but please understand that there are restricOons on the jurisdicOon of the Board and what we can / cannot do. We need certain specific informaOon to move forward with a case. We can definitely work with you to make sure your complaint is filed correctly with the informaOon needed and focused on possible violaOons of the Act that we can address, and then we can begin an inquiry and see where that leads us.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?

  Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I
    Page 387 of 797

            previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

SecOon 1001.407 TBPE Guide for any license engineer working on "Public Work" must support his work with 3 parts (a) Plan (b) SpecificaOons and (3) EsOmates.
I am asking for the (b) and (c). They must be in your possession from the person who sealed the design plan.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail.
The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process
        Page 396 of 797

  here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
  I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020

   telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

I have been waiOng for "calculaOons or esOmates" for last 2 days and today will be the last day of wait. I will wait Oll COB Aug-03-2018 for them. If there are somethings not turned in, I will assume that you all do not have in your possession.
I am now requesOng you "ALL VERSIONS of ALL DRAWINGs", their respecOve "ESTIMATES or CALCULATIONS" along with their "SPECIFICATIONS" specific to this Anderson Mill expansion project.
Please send all copies to Anderson.Mill.Road@gmail.com. (This is my alias email to hold big files and records).
I am also a]aching in CC a copy of this thread to the AdministraOve and LegislaOve office of Cedar Park ("Mayor of Cedar Park", and "City Secretary").

SecOon 1001.407 TBPE Guide for any license engineer working on "Public Work" must support his work with 3 parts (a) Plan (b) SpecificaOons and (3) EsOmates.
I am asking for the (b) and (c). They must be in your possession from the person who sealed the design plan.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
          Page 411 of 797

                 Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight

               road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).

                     Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

 Hi Darwin,
                    I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S
fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

I have been doing this for 25 years and am a registered professional engineer. I am 100% certain that the esOmate relates to the cost of the project. What field of engineering is your wife registered as a professional engineer in?

I think you are mistaken on the esOmate part.
The context of the clause is on safety, and welfare and I believe the esOmates are also associated to the safety and not to cost.
The state or a political subdivision of the state may not construct a public work involving engineering in which the public h
ealth, welfare,
or safety is involved, unless:
(1) th
e engineering plans, specifications, and estimates have been prepared by an engineer; and (2) the engineering construction is to be performed under the direct supervision of an engineer

SecOon 1001.407 TBPE Guide for any license engineer working on "Public Work" must support his work with 3 parts (a) Plan (b) SpecificaOons and (3) EsOmates.
I am asking for the (b) and (c). They must be in your possession from the person who sealed the design plan.

Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can
        Page 430 of 797

  be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I
have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
       Page 437 of 797

 2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
   Page 438 of 797

  I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.

       Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug-03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your
         Page 452 of 797

              picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
        I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about

              the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

                    Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Your email was a bit longer so I had to take some additional time to consume it.
There was of course some miscommunication because I do not recall any request for additional complain or reasons tell me to split the complaint into 2.
Anyways, I want to start by sharing few things.
1. Cedar Park(Just a 15-20 min drive from your TBPE HQ) has an Engineering Department that has been developing roads and taking up similar public domain projects. The engineers here (Not just Mr. Darwin, Mr. Alan, but all) are in the malpractice of doing projects without any due diligence, w/o any calculations, nor asking for the calculations from the companies that develop drawings, project
layouts, and material requirements from the last 20+ years (I have this in writing from Mr. Darwin, Licensed PE Engineer). Proof of it was in the complaints. Does this even make sense? Is that Texas standard? Why is even a PE engineer required?
2. When raised concerns of safety, they nor any other engineering came to review. They are *not* ready to review the safety part. Part of this was in complaint. I do not know if you all are just paper reviewers or can come down to review.. and what is the process here.
3. Licensed Engineers nor unlicensed engineer tool Any permits for the construction of the roads. The road "Anderson Mill Rd" is next to a Federal Structure called BCCP that needs special permits for construction. A simple call or FOIA would reveal to you the same that I am claiming. I can also help you find the rules if someone is struggling.
4. FOIA to the local police will reveal the high traffic and accidents in the area. The roads, the turns, and crossings are NOT safe. There is no way you can even get to the merge lane without violation of safety law and pass 10 ft. beyond stop signs.
I do not have any confidence in the city or their engineering for the safety parameters if they have any. Now whall all do you need from me to start an inquiry so that I can at least have safety tests performed by TBPE to validate if this is safe?
Is there anything that you can do for me, my family, travelers, and pedestrian's safety?
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
  Page 460 of 797

 I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.

He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who

If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

This is yet another request or reminder. I am looking for a wri]en results to your invesOgaOon for the case that i raised with concerns of gross negligence by city officials in building the road. I was told that TBPE can not invesOgate because it was Mr. Green who is non PE and has been the engineer in the project. I am marking Mr. Lance in cc here.

The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug- 03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

          Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American
        Page 474 of 797

             AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
     Page 477 of 797

                  The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your

                   property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon.
The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).

Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals.

Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.

Mr. Michael:
We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any
research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:
Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'. Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists his Roles and Responsibilities?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

          The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug- 03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously
    Page 492 of 797

          stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon.
The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are

TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any
research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

          The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug- 03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously
    Page 513 of 797

          stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon.
The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any
research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

          The project started in May-2018 and wasn't close to completion in Aug- 03-2018 (Actually I think it officially got completed in Aug or Sept of 2019) when I got this email below.
Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously
    Page 534 of 797

          stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon.
The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

It appears there has been some miscommunicaOon or misunderstanding on this issue.
I rereviewed our previous correspondence on this issue. My review shows that we corresponded throughout early February 2020 via email and then culminated with a telephone call on February 11. From my recollecOon, during that phone call I relayed to you the jurisdicOon and authority of the Board. I communicated that the Board only has jurisdicOon over unlicensed individuals if they have engaged in the pracOce of engineering and over professional engineers if they have violated the Texas Engineering PracOce Act or Board rules.
I sOll have the original complaint you sent via email on February 4, 2020. During the February 11, 2020 telephone call, I believe I relayed to you that none of the evidence you provided with your complaint showed that Mr. Green (a non P.E.) had engaged in the pracOce of engineering or that Mr. Marchell (a P.E.) had violated any Board rules. I also relayed the type of evidence we would need to move forward with a complaint and also that we would need separate complaint forms against each individual rather than one form addressing both individuals. I was under the impression that you were clear on what the Board would need to move forward. Absent one addiOonal email on February 18, 2020, I do not see where we ever received the separate complaint forms from you (one against Mr. Green only and a separate one against Mr. Marchell only). As such, I was under the impression that you were no longer pursuing this ma]er with the Board. I have no record of any addiOonal communicaOon unOl you reached out on August 13, 2021.
The Board does not have a statute of limitaOons, so I am unclear what Oming out in court you are referencing in your 8:40 PM email from August 18. If you wish to proceed with the complaints, you sOll can as long as they are filed correctly (separate complaint forms with supporOng documentaOon against each individual) and we will begin the invesOgaOon process.
Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any
research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
    Page 555 of 797

          I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

               When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

For your informaOon when looking at these plan sheets, the turn lane has been reduced from 12 feet to 11 feet wide and this change is not depicted. I will be in the field at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning to measure and I have requested that the contractor and our inspector be present as well.

Darwin,
I am a licensed P.E. and I want to evaluate the drawings for the Anderson mill road adjacent to our home.
Please send me all revisions of the stamped drawings of the road adjacent to my property.
Please call me at5129991426 before coming here to measure the distance of road to our property line.

                 My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 S from the property line.
Please give me the window when you can be available.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

                  With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon.
The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the
roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

   The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

     Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the
         Page 578 of 797

            roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Are you available for coming down to the property and show us the 11 S distance that you talked about? Also, Please send a copy of the
drawings (or bring it for us to scan it) of the road that shows the claimed distance from my property line.
My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 S from the property line.
Please give me the window when you can be available.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
     Page 581 of 797

                 The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb
   Page 582 of 797

                  and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).

Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case.

I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting
for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.

Sandeep,

           Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).

             There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

                 Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

Here is the email where I have the copy of the complaints (1st and 2nd) - 1st one was from Mrs. Deepshikha Kalra. It was filed via post, and 2nd one was filed by me online - email might be a mix of "anderson.mill.road@gmail.com", "sandeep.kalra@gmail.com", and/or "gaspar.bend@gmail.com". I use all these 3 emails.

Mr. Sims:
PFA PDF copy w/ proofs of the complaint that was filed on January-17th of 2019. It was submitted to TBPE on my request by my wife (Deepshikha Kalra). The complaint was not electronic, so copy of that is attached.
The 2nd complaint was in the form of an email. It was submitted by me from my other email address (Anderson.Mill.Road@gmail.com) on Feb-22-2019 (Sorry I thought I did it in June, but it was in Feb)
The attachments are beyond the 25MB limit, so you may get a link to PDF. If TBPE Filters out these links then I am happy to send a copy of these in the mail. At a high level, In my complaints, I have highlighted how the engineers (not just Mr. Green, Mr. Darwin but all of those who have worked for Cedar Park and were involved in Anderson Mill Rd expansion) have not followed §1001.407 and have used no calculations what so ever for any public work. More so, they claim that this is the de-facto standard for them for the last 25 years. Given that 18 wheelers are now coming as close as 10 ft to my property and there are no calculations, nor comparisons make me worried every day!
Since 2019, we have also seen retaliation from Mr. Greens and Mr. Darwin (PE), and that will now be an additional complaint that I seek to file.

Mr. Danielle DeVellis:
My wife (Deepshikha Kalra, in CC) received an inquiry(copy attached) from you related to case E-38585. She is sick, so I am trying to answer it to the best of my knowledge (and I prefer email for all communication).
1. Response to your case file E-38585 was dispatched by my wife on Jan-07-2020. The returned confirmation receipt and tracking number shows that it was received by your office on Jan-08-2020.
2. A copy of the response she sent on Jan-07-2020 is also attached anyways. In case you have not received the mail yet then this email must do the needful.
At this point, I want to highlight to you that this act by Mr. Darwin Marchell, P.E. and Alan Green is "act of retaliation" against me and my family just discovered through questions that they and many in cedar park engineering department are putting "business calculations" in place of "safety/engineering calculations" to do civil work from last 20 YEARS (email confirmation from them regarding it can be sent to you and to others in TBPE for reading). They even do not do comparative study.
Not only that, the city has not taken any permits for making road next to BCCP (confirmed via Travis County open records), not left mandatory 30 feet distance from BCCP, have not done any pollution and noise checks, and now its compliance department isn't even registering the complaint (Against city for noise, safety and smoke violations) to check against the city's own rules and regulations that they want others to comply.

     We did raised the concern to TBPE by reporting it and asking for inquiry in Jan-2019, and then Feb-2019 and then Nov-2019. All these were surprisingly not even considered.
To me, it seems like a joke or a serious *under-developed country* style corruption. Everyone is saving each other.

Mr. Lance:
TBPE helping me to file a complaint is "new news" to me. It never happened. Unless you have proof, please do not go there.
My only interaction outside of email with Mr. Michael was on this 1 phone call where the subject of discussion was "Mr. Darwin's Participation". He clearly mentioned to me that all drawings, projects are made by some 3rd party and Mr. Alan is executing it. There is no Mr. Darwin's participation and hence TBPE is unable to pursue the case. All other parts of complaints that I or my wife has made are outside the window of review (** As if he wanted this to land outside the window of the review too, and he did it. **)
Do you keep recordings of phone calls?

We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of
           Page 619 of 797

          the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Subject: Re: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
         Page 620 of 797

            If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

               Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).
Thanks.

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er

                to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is
helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons. Thanks,

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will

The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Mr. Michael:
We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:

his Roles and Responsibilities?

  Mr. Kalra:
Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

      Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Mr. Michael:
We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:

his Roles and Responsibilities?

 Mr. Kalra:
 Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

      Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?
Best Regards, Sandeep Kalra

Mr. Michael:
We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:
Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'. Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists
his Roles and Responsibilities?

 Mr. Kalra:
 Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

      Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded
without them.
How can Mr. Darwin not be part of this project? In my understanding, Mr. Alan, Mr. Sam Roberts, and Mr. Darwin all were involved in the project.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These
    Page 679 of 797

     design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly
           Page 683 of 797

        showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
  There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub- clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Hi Darwin,

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:24:16 Central Standard Time
                I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly
           Page 698 of 797

        showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
  There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub- clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Hi Darwin,

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:24:20 Central Standard Time
                I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly
           Page 713 of 797

        showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
  There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub- clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).
Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Hi Darwin,

Tuesday, December 6, 2022 at 17:24:24 Central Standard Time
                I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Mr. Michael:
We are talking of real lives on the road being risked here.
I will bring you back to speed with this. We filed the complaint two times but were ignored by TBPE for one reason or others. [I guess you and many were waiting for me to be timed out (in court). Isn't it?]
The complaint and request to take action were with TBPE the day my wife filed officially while the project was being executed, and then I forced myself into filing a complaint again (online). Moreover, I also involved Mr. Lance in later stages to make sure that I am talking to someone correct in authority, and then it was you who showed up to give me arguments that Mr. Darwin is in fact not part of the project. Mr. Alan was the engineer executing it. All I am asking is that if you did any research then give it to me in writing.
Mr. Lance:
Mr. Michaels title says 'Director of Compliance & Enforcement'. Can you kindly point me to the webpage or documentation that lists
his Roles and Responsibilities?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.

  If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded without them.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
      Page 724 of 797

      The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

         Alan, Darwin,
  When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

Hi Darwin,
There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Unfortunately, I do not remember a lot of the specifics about this case 18 months later other than what I was able to find from our previous e-mail correspondence. That being said, based on this review, it is my understanding that you wanted to file complaints against employees with the City of Cedar Park about a road design but had no evidence to show that they designed the road themselves or even engaged in the pracOce of engineering as it relates to the project. I recall the design was done by a third party engineering firm, but could not find anything to verify this. From the correspondence I could review from February 2020, it looks like we had a teleconference about this issue and discussed what informaOon the Board would need to be able to move forward and no addiOonal informaOon was ever provided.
If you would like to formally file the complaint you can, but without evidence that the individual either violated Board rules while engaged in the pracOce of engineering or was unlicensed and pracOced engineering, the Board would not be able to move forward.

Highlighted in red(in his email below) that shows Mr. Darwin overlooked the progress and was responsible to work with engineers who developed design and must have produced calculations for the development.
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Alan were there at the site and met my wife to do the readings. Mr. Darwin and others Knew that the calculations did not exist, yet they proceeded
without them.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you
           Page 743 of 797

        show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
  Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
    The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with

Dear Mr. Michael
This is yet another request or reminder. I am looking for a wri]en results to your invesOgaOon for the case that i raised with concerns of gross negligence by city officials in building the road. I was told that TBPE can not invesOgate because it was Mr. Green who is non PE and has been the engineer in the project. I am marking Mr. Lance in cc here.

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis
    for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design

    for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

Subject: Re: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion Alan, Darwin,
When I talked to you and others in first meeOng at CP main office, you all kept saying lies that there is a 10+ S distance between the property line and the any road... When I asked for barrier you gave it but then removed because as per you they wanted them in other locaOon... The drawings had only the distance of a walkway between fence and turn road from day-01. You all traumaOzed us for 1.5 yrs with lies about the plan and deliberately keep it hidden so that you all can execute this without resistance. The drawings are clearly showing only a walkway distance and nothing more (zoomed part here).
          Page 757 of 797

         There is a 12 S si~ng right in between the road for nothing. There can be a simple barrier from stopping southbound to enter but instead you all took that land from my side and is now jeopardizing everyone life.
I am not buying your speculaOons and assumpOons and speculaOon about the traffic. Send me the specs and calculaOons that were used to make this drawing and in determining that the slow traffic on straight road in this situaOon will not cause a impact to human. What probability was calculated?
If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats
to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).

Sandeep,
I would like to respond to your request for the “S” (specificaOons) and “E” (EsOmate) part of the PS&E for the project. We provided you with the specificaOons for the project as well as links to where those specificaOons can be found on Wednesday. We also provided the esOmate although we disagree as to what the term “esOmate” is defined as. The esOmate is required to be provided by the engineer so that he can assure his client as to what the probable cost will be for the project so that the client will know if it is within their budget and they can proceed with construcOon of the project.
The calculaOons that you have requested simply do not exist. I have checked with the engineer that designed these construcOon plans and the only calculaOons that they performed are the drainage calculaOons which are found in the plans. As I previously stated, design of the roadway is based upon design criteria provided in
    Page 767 of 797

   the AASHTO green book, the City of AusOn TransportaOon Criteria Manual (which the City of Cedar Park has adopted), and TxDOT’s Design Manual. These manuals are used as a basis for the cross secOon design of the roadway as well as the geometric design of the roadway. These design criteria are used by transportaOon engineers throughout Texas and the United States.
I was hoping to relay this informaOon and discuss it further with you during our 9:00 meeOng yesterday at your house. We met with your wife instead and measured and verified that the dimensions shown on the plans are correct and meet the design criteria shown in the design manuals.
I noOced that you have CC’ed LeAnn Quinn on your email. I would suggest contacOng Ms. Quinn directly and she can help you through the open records request process. Please let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Sandeep,
Let address some of the issues that you menOon below.
First, the distance from the roadway to the property line is measured from the face of curb of the through lane, not the right turn lane. As I menOoned in my earlier email, it is measured that way because the vehicles traveling in the right turn lane are deceleraOng.
Second, we have not lied, hidden informaOon or misled you in any way. In the drawing you have zoomed into below, your property line is the dashed one below the bold line that is labeled as the handrail. The handrail is not located on the property line. There are several feet between your property line and the sidewalk. The wooden stake that you show in your picture is an offset stake, not where the edge of the roadway is going to be.
Third, the 12 foot si~ng right in the middle is there to keep opposing lanes of traffic separated. These medians are used on most of our arterial roadways.
Fourth, I am not sure what specs and calculaOons you are looking for. The roadway cross secOons can be found in the City of AusOn’s TransportaOon Criteria Manual which the City of Cedar Park has adopted. The cross secOons and other design parameters are what the design engineer uses to design the roadways as they are based upon the AASHTO (American AssociaOon of State Highway TransportaOon Officials) design manual. This manual is used all over the United States by professional engineers.
Alan will be happy to meet you tomorrow morning at 9am to measure these distances as was discussed in his earlier email.

There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats
to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).

            I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.

 my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

If I find flaw in calculaOons or no calculaOons to support at all, then I am going with this to the TBPE for reporOng this. If the engineers would have read the TBPE Lawrule at least once they would have seen 32 places it's menOoned about safety in clauses and sub-clauses.

A]ached are the requested plan sheets. For your informaOon when looking at these plan sheets, the turn lane has been reduced from 12 feet to 11 feet wide and this change is not depicted. I will be in the field at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning to measure and I have requested that the contractor and our inspector be present as well.

I am a licensed P.E. and I want to evaluate the drawings for the Anderson mill road adjacent to our home.
Please send me all revisions of the stamped drawings of the road adjacent to my property.
Please call me at5129991426 before coming here to measure the distance of road to our property line.

Are you available for coming down to the property and show us the 11 S distance that you talked about? Also, Please send a copy of the drawings (or bring it for us to scan it) of the road that shows the claimed distance from my property line.
My wife (in CC) who is also a P.E. Engineer and works with TMC will be there to see the drawings and confirm if the road is actually 11 S from the property line.
Please give me the window when you can be available.

           There are a lot of "assumpOons" you are making (drivers will be slowing down, and as the road is straight, so they will drive straight), and unless you have very solid stats
to prove it, I have every reason to believe that they do not always hold true.
The fact is that the only safety aspect that you have in place is the basic "raised curb" along with the maintaining the minimum distance of turn road and straight roads and this isn't enough in my mind.
I may decide to sell and move out of the property and/or create my own barriers so that reaching the inside would be difficult but every morning and aSernoon elementary students from this neighborhood walk towards their school(Deer Creek Elem) and back home. There are a lot of joggers that also take that way. This will not only put my family at risk but will create a risk for everyone who will take that side path to walk that way.
I hope you understand that all liabiliOes will rest with you and the city of cedar park for anything that goes wrong.
With this email, I will rest my case and will leave up to you (as a representaOve of the city of cedar park) to decide and take acOon (or not).
Thanks.

Mr. Kalra:
I wanted to respond to your request for a 3 foot barrier along the edge of your property. The edge of the right turn lane pavement will be 11 feet from your property line, exceeding the desired minimum of 10 feet for a turn lane. The right turn lane will also be bound by raised curb and gu]er to provide an addiOonal barrier for traffic. Also, please keep in mind that the vehicles in the right turn lane will be deceleraOng to make the turn into Gaspar Bend and they will not be traveling at the same speed as those vehicles in the through lanes. The edge of the outside northbound through lane will be approximately 22 feet from your property line exceeding the 15 foot desired minimum for through lanes. There will also be a raised
   Page 787 of 797

            curb and gu]er median that will provide addiOonal separaOon to separate both the northbound and southbound traffic which increases safety in this locaOon. The City is installing a barrier further north from you since the outside northbound through lane will be less than 10 feet to some property lines and these properOes are on a curve in the roadway. Since your property is on a straight secOon of roadway and the right turn lane is a similar distance to your property as in many other locaOons, a barrier is not warranted in this locaOon. I hope this informaOon is helpful. Let me know if you have any addiOonal quesOons.
Thanks, Darwin

Subject: Project : Anderson Mill Rd Expansion
Hi Darwin,
I live right on Anderson Mill Rd. There is an expansion going on where the lanes are converOng from exisOng 2 lanes to 4 lanes.
When this project started, we had a meeOng with the city, and I clearly menOoned my concerns. They included many things including safety, noise, polluOon etc. In the city meeOng, we were told that the city will give a 3 S fence because the road is coming so close to the property. They did to all but not to 1 house (just mine).
The arguments given by Alan are not saOsfying as they do not provide me with an answer as to what city engineering team is doing for the safety of the resident, visitors on or near my property.
     Page 788 of 797

             Can you let me know what is city doing engineering-wise for our safety?

Dear Mr. Lance.
I am wriOng to you to request an in-person representaOon of TBPE in a fully recorded meeOng that I have requested for the Cedar Park City Engineers and management.
Mr. Darwin Marchell, P.E. has shared the following link about specificaOons on Aug-01-2018.
h]p://www.dot.state.tx.us/apps-cg/specs/SearchForm.asp?type=7
I am pasOng an excerpt from the spec on this link:
"Design Calculations. Include calculations covering the range of heights and loading conditions on the project.
Calculations for both internal and external stability as described on the plans will be required. Include a summary of all
design parameters used; material types, strength values, and assumed allowable; loads and loading combinations; and factor-
of-safety parameters."
AND, at the same Ome, I have this email(attached as PDF, because of the email history) where Mr. Darwin who is represenOng the city engineers is trying to tell me that calculaOons are business-calculaOons and that is how the city has operated from last 20+ years.
Mr. Sam Roberts, P.E. has come forward to clarify my doubts about the noise and polluOon that the structure is now producing was never a responsibility of the city even when written concerns were given to them before the work started, and I may need some assistance from TBPE to cross-examine the facts as and when they are presented to me in the meeOng.
I am hoping that TBPE will accept the request for joining the meeOng.

Thanks for the clarificaOon about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.
I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.
Is this response of yours an official response of the City?
ArOcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or a]ached to the motor vehicle.
o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Ores on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaOons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
I am not a legal expert and I will try ge~ng legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.
I am available mostly on Fridays aSer 2:00 PM. I will only come if the session is fully recorded (Audio and Video) that I will also get access to it, and will like to know the parOcipant's name 2 days before hand.

Dear Mr. Kalra. The purpose of this communicaOon to you is to try to answer some of the quesOons and concerns in your last 2 emails (below) and to provide some informaOon that you may or may not be aware of. Below is a bullet summary of this informaOon I wish to convey to you:
· First of all I need to inform you that Chris Copple, Robert, Kevin and Amber do not enforce the city’s Noise RegulaOons, ArOcle 8.08. The Noise RegulaOons are enforced by the Cedar Park Police Department.
o If you wish to report a noise complaint (excluding noise from vehicles in the public right-of-way, see below) call 911 or call the Police Department’s main number 512-260- 4600.
· Secondly, I need to tell you that the City’s Noise RegulaOons, specifically, ArOcle 8.008.005 (3) grant an exempOon to sounds produced by motor vehicles in the public right-of-way (e.g. Anderson Mill Rd). See verbiage from the city’s ordinance below:
        ArOcle 8.008.005 (3) Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while

  the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound producing equipment within the motor vehicle or a]ached to the motor vehicle.
o And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the Ores on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulaOons, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.
· And Lastly, regarding your complaint about the air contaminants coming from Anderson Mill Rd onto your property exceeding the City’s Environmental Standards Ordinance ArOcle 8.12, I need to inform you that these regulaOons apply to air contaminants generated by uses within properOes or “zoning districts” around the City and the thresholds are measured at the property boundary. These regulaOons do not apply to public roadways, except during the construcOon of such public roadways.
In closing, I would like to offer to meet with you to try to answer any quesOons you may have. I will need to include some of the subject ma]er experts such as the engineers who worked on the roadway in such a meeOng. If you would like to meet, please let me know of some dates and Omes you are available. And please also feel free to call me at the number below.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).
The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road". By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:
(1) DayOme: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or
(2) Nigh~me: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C
      Page 794 of 797

    The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.
I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.
Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.
A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
