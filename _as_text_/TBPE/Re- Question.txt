Mr. Kalra,

We have received your information and have opened a file.  It is now in our standard complaint process.  We will let you know if we need any additional information.  Complaints can take differing amounts of time to process depending on the content and issues at hand as well as staff workload.  We will update you periodically as required by our process.  You will be notified by the board when the process is complete and a final resolution has been reached.

While I case is open we cannot release any details of the complaint.  After that, you can request the complaint information from the board.

Have a good weekend.

Sincerely,

Subject: Question

Hi Mr. Lance and Mr. Michael:

Now that I have submitted this formal complaint (again) I want to know the overall procedure at your end. Is there a place in time when you think that the submitted proofs are not enough and you need more, and I can add to the list? At what point will I come to know of the judgement if any?

Also, what will be the way to get details of the inquiry and cross submissions from PE Engineer here. Will I have to file FOIA to get the submissions from defendant side?
