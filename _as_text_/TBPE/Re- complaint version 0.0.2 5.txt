Filename: Should I be calling you? How can I get proof that you have received the media successfully?

PS: Also, the flash drive will have 16 movie files (a few are QT extensions and will need Apple Quick Time to play). This is where youtube could have been a better choice.

When you get here, please come to our back door (Follow the driveway to the left around the corner of the building).  There is a doorbell that you can ring at the door and someone will come meet you to get the flash drive from you.

Mr. Sims:
Thanks for confirming. I will be down there today on or before 3:30 pm to hand over the proof to you in person.

I have already completed youtube uploads too, and one file was found duplicate and 2 files were corrupted. Also, one video was 110 MB so it is large, so I added other 3 or 4 video files that I initially did not give in the report. It does not matter if you ignore or add them to the list. I can just sit for a few hours and record more violations.

If you are ok delivering them, I think a flash drive would probably be easier for us than Youtube.  Or if they are not huge files, attaching them to an email will also work.

While the upload to youtube is getting finished, I will like to know if you still want the pictures and videos in flash drive. This property of mine is just 15-20 min away from your office and can drive to give it by hand. Is that okay with you? I can come down today at 3:30 PM. Please let me know by 2:30 PM CST Today

Mr. Kalra:

Our IT security does not allow me to access the links to the photos or videos from your Google drive.  Can you attach those directly to an email and send them to me directly or alternatively, put them on a thumb drive and mail them to our office.
