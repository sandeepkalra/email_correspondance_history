Subject: Reporting under - Texas Penal Code Section 38.171(b)

Mr. Jill, Ms. Darlene:

I think you must act on this reporting by me that I think that the road that the city engineers have built is a threat and can cause serious bodily injuries to humans, and endangered species.

You must now report this to the correct authorities that have the power to take action, as I have no clue whom to report otherwise.

PS: Please keep my name anonymous. This email is sent to only you two.

Best regards

Dear Mr. Lance.

I am writing to you to request an in-person representation of TBPE in a fully recorded meeting that I have requested for the Cedar Park City Engineers and management.

Mr. Darwin Marchell, P.E. has shared the following link about specifications on Aug-01-2018.

http://www.dot.state.tx.us/apps-cg/specs/SearchForm.asp?type=7

I am pasting an excerpt from the spec on this link:
"Design Calculations. Include calculations covering the range of heights and loading conditions on the project. Calculations for both internal and external stability as described on the plans will be required. Include a summary of all design parameters used; material types, strength values, and assumed allowable; loads and loading combinations; and factor-of-safety parameters."

AND, at the same time, I have this email(attached as PDF, because of the email history) where Mr. Darwin who is representing the city engineers is trying to tell me that calculations are business-calculations and that is how the city has operated from last 20+ years.

Mr. Sam Roberts, P.E. has come forward to clarify my doubts about the noise and pollution that the structure is now producing was never a responsibility of the city even when written concerns were given to them before the work started, and I may need some assistance from TBPE to cross-examine the facts as and when they are presented to me in the meeting.

I am hoping that TBPE will accept the request for joining the meeting.

Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra

Mr. Sam:

Thanks for the clarification about ownership of noise compliance. I was not aware of it.

I have raised my concern(mailed them twice) for high-speed traffic and safety concerns along with noise compliance requests to law enforcement too. I have also asked them to install a battery and solar operated speedometer to show to the travelers the speed. I do not anticipate them to stand there all the time. Till now I have not heard back anything from them.

Is this response of yours an official response of the City?


 Article 8.008.005 (3)     Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound-producing equipment within the motor vehicle or attached to the motor vehicle.

o   And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the tires on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulations, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.

I am not a legal expert and I will try getting legal help to cross-examine the claims if this is an official response.

I am available mostly on Fridays after 2:00 PM.  I will only come if the session is fully recorded (Audio and Video) that I will also get access to it, and will like to know the participant's name 2 days before hand.

Dear Mr. Kalra.   The purpose of this communication to you is to try to answer some of the questions and concerns in your last 2 emails (below) and to provide some information that you may or may not be aware of.   Below is a bullet summary of this information I wish to convey to you:


•         First of all I need to inform you that Chris Copple, Robert, Kevin and Amber do not enforce the city’s Noise Regulations, Article 8.08.   The Noise Regulations are enforced by the Cedar Park Police Department.

o   If you wish to report a noise complaint (excluding noise from vehicles in the public right-of-way, see below) call 911 or call the Police Department’s main number 512-260-4600.

•         Secondly, I need to tell you that the City’s Noise Regulations, specifically, Article 8.008.005 (3) grant an exemption to sounds produced by motor vehicles in the public right-of-way (e.g. Anderson Mill Rd).  See verbiage from the city’s ordinance below:
Article 8.008.005 (3)     Sound produced by a motor vehicle motor in good working order while the motor vehicle is moving on a public right-of-way, public waterway, airport runway, or railroad. This does not include sound produced by sound producing equipment within the motor vehicle or attached to the motor vehicle.

o   And while we acknowledge your complaint that the noise from the tires on cars and trucks travelling on Anderson Mill Rd is exceeding the maximum decibel levels in the noise regulations, this noise is considered to be part of the noise generated by the motor vehicle and is therefore exempt.

•         And Lastly, regarding your complaint about the air contaminants coming from Anderson Mill Rd onto your property exceeding the City’s Environmental Standards Ordinance Article 8.12, I need to inform you that these regulations apply to air contaminants generated by uses within properties or “zoning districts” around the City and the thresholds are measured at the property boundary.  These regulations do not apply to public roadways, except during the construction of such public roadways.
In closing, I would like to offer to meet with you to try to answer any questions you may have.   I will need to include some of the subject matter experts such as the engineers who worked on the roadway in such a meeting.   If you would like to meet, please let me know of some dates and times you are available.   And please also feel free to call me at the number below.

Sincerely,

Sam P. Roberts, P.E.

Subject: Re:  Request for Information on grave concerns from resident of the city.
﻿
Mr. Robert, Mr. Kevin, Ms. Amber:

This is my 2nd reminder email to take action on my complaint of non-compliance by the city by building structure next to my property. The city is not compliant to :

§ 8.08 noise regulation not met on my property.
§ 8.12 pollution and smoke due to structure on my property.

Please give me a complaint-ID or tracking number or simple email reply in writing to confirm that you are or will be investigating this issue.

If there is 'No action' on your part, and not even registering the case, then I will go to TCOLE for help.

Dear Robert, Kevin and Amber.

You are mentioned as "Compliance Officers" on Cedar Park TX page. I am making a request for compliance with this email (with some journalist, Engineers and City Mayor in CC).

The city of cedar park has expanded "Anderson Mill road".  By doing so, they have violated my rights. The city under their own compliance rules of section 8.08 Noise regulations makes it mandatory for any party to make noise beyond these limits:

(1)     Daytime: 70 dB(A) or 80 dB(C); or

(2)     Nighttime: 50 dB(A) or 60 dB(C

The construction from Anderson Mill road has now impacted me as now the noise level on my property is way above 100+db at night and 150+db at daytime. This is coming from the tires of the passing traffic. The compliance rule under exemption of 8.08.005 does allow noise from only the motor of the motor-vehicle to be unaccounted (which I did when I measured using my equipments). I want the city to comply to the nuisance of road and vehicles by either disallowing the vehicles making noise to be stopped or make adjustments of the road and its boundaries to not produce this noise inside my property line.

I have request city many times via email to come and test using beam forming microphones to do a  compliance reading but I guess I wasn't taking to right people.

Official procedure will require "Acoustic Beam forming" to measure noises other than of tires . I think there are plenty of contractors out there who have this equipment ready and if not I am happy to refer to you few contractors who can do the compliance reading.

A detail of procedure can be found in this book recommended by the US body of National Cooperative Highway Research Program(NCHRP):
