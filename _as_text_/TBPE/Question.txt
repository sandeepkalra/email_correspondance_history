Filename: Hi Mr. Lance and Mr. Michael:

Now that I have submitted this formal complaint (again) I want to know the overall procedure at your end. Is there a place in time when you think that the submitted proofs are not enough and you need more, and I can add to the list? At what point will I come to know of the judgement if any?

Also, what will be the way to get details of the inquiry and cross submissions from PE Engineer here. Will I have to file FOIA to get the submissions from defendant side?
