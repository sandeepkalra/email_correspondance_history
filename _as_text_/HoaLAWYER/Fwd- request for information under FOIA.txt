Filename: Dear Mr. Kalra,

Property owners associations are not subject to the Public Information Act.

As we have informed you in the past, the roads in question are not association property they are public roads, and the association has no authority to enforce governmental traffic laws on these roads.  Nor does the association have authority to install traffic-calming devices such as speed monitors in the road’s right of way, or speed humps.  Any decision in that regard would be made and executed by the appropriate governmental authorities.

To the extent you or any other POA member believes that traffic violations are occurring, you are encouraged to report them to local law enforcement, who would be the appropriate body to enforce traffic violations.

Dear WBC board members:

I have numerous times raised safety concerns due to 18-wheelers and fuel tankers passing through the neighborhood. Safety is my right and you are there to protect me. I have asked this board to act on many occasions and have copied almost all incidents that I have reported, and I have specifically asked this board to raise in writing to the city so that a legal case can be pre prepared. I have asked the reply to this request 2 times in last 2+ months, and after waiting for 2 months I am bound to ask the same using FOIA.

I have some questions and I need the answers. This request is made under FOIA:
[1]- was there any legal request made by this board or board members during the period of jan-01-2022 till nov-01-2022 that raised the same concerns to the cedar park city.
[2]- was there any legal request made by the city to the board and/or members, during the same period to act on the concerns of the residents of the neighborhood?
[3]- in the case of [1] or [2], was there any action taken by this board?


Please let me know the response in some reasonable days.

Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra
