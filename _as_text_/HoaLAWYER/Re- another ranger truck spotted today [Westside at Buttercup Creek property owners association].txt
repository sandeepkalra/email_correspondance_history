Dear Mr. Kalra,

Our firm represents the Westside at Buttercup Creek property owners association.  Please direct any further correspondence related to the association to me.

I have reviewed your correspondence below.  This is to clarify that the roads in question are public roads, and the association has no authority to enforce governmental traffic laws on these roads.  Nor does the association have authority to install traffic-calming devices such as speed monitors in the road’s right of way, or speed humps.  Any decision in that regard would be made and executed by the appropriate governmental authorities.

I am aware of no ordinance or law that would prohibit the trucks in question from using these public roads — to my knowledge they have the right to use these roads just as does any other vehicle.  The two videos you shared in the chain both show a truck slowly pulling up to a stop sign and then turning right onto the adjacent road.  In one of them a school bus pulls up behind the truck and waits its turn to turn onto the adjacent road.

I understand that as an owner with a home in close proximity to the intersection of which you sent the video, that you would prefer larger vehicles not to use the public roads in this area.  I imagine most all property owners association members would also prefer less traffic on the public roads near their homes.  However vehicles have a right to use public roads and the association cannot stop them or affect the driving behavior of road users.

To the extent you or any other POA member believes that traffic violations are occurring, you are encouraged to report them to local law enforcement, who would be the appropriate body to enforce traffic violations.

Thank you.

Dear WBC and Cedar Park Council:

When an unauthorized truck crosses the neighborhood, it puts hundreds of lives in danger. Most of these trucks cross 40 to 50 households (roughly 200 people), and numerous pedestrians, school kids.  I  hope you all understand the gravity of the situation.  These roads are not prepared with any people's safety concerns in mind.. Most of the engineers were paper-pushers. Wilco has been well aware of this for years. I have reported about 50 to 100 incidents in the last 3-4 yrs and most of them carry proof, date, time. I also gave numerous suggestions to block them - some daring and some simple as putting solar speed trackers and road-bumpers.

I have asked many times for proof to both the city and HOA that you all are noticing the safety lapse issues and have taken legal actions or not. I have not gotten a single reply to any communication.. looks to me like interacting with morally dead people here. I will now be opening a legal FOIA request to see which of my representatives are failing to act. I will also find if there is a legal action that can be taken on individuals who are holding the power (either getting paid or volunteering).. but not respecting the safety of hundreds. The range of date I will be requesting will be 2022-Jan-01 till 2022-Nov-01 (both dates included).

Here is the link to the video from today (Incident time: 4:48 PM CST, 2022-Nov-07th) where a Ranger Truck with liquid (possibly, and it does *not* look like water-tanker to me), right in front of a school bus.
