## Introduction
This is compilation of all emails that I have exchanged with different government and non-government entities within USA asking for safety for me and others. After 7+ yrs of repeated getting ignored, I have decided to publicly fight this and also probably go to court and ask for justice.
This emails captures how
 - The city of Cedar Park TX that list safety as priority has not done any safety calculations for any road projects done in last 30 yrs.
 - On no project do they even take any permits. For e.g. the road next to FWS/BCCP federal land reserved for wildlife, they said they are working within their rights. Next I hear is in 2022 US FWS tells the world of loosing 10+ species permanently. Is this Joke?
 - On asking for safety, they have not taken any action.
 - On producing video evidence about safety concerns due to high traffic and "un-authorised" access by 18 wheelers and gas(gasoline/petroleum) trucks access neightborhood they did nothing for 4+ yrs. I have to write real nasty emails to just wake them, and who knows if this is temporary or permanent.
 - HOA has "contract" with home owners called "bylaws and C.C.R". They overlooked them even after repeatedly telling them that the contract list "safety" and they are responsible for raising voice to city.
 - Each incident from last 4+ yrs has risked more than 200 neightbors, and probably me more than 200 times per day.


## How to use this repo
This repo has a folder called `_with_` that lists all email transactions. It also has tools that I developed for seaching faster. These tools convert .eml to .txt (just outer email, and not attachments). This tool works on linux and `*nix` platforms.
If you clone this repo, then on compliant systems, run `./setup.searchable.sh` and it will create a folder called `_as_text_` that will have text copies. All .eml should work with legally purchased microsoft-outlook or with more other email platforms.
